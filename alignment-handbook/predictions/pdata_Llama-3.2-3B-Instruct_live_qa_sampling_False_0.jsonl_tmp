If so, when does it take place?assistant\n\nA molar pregnancy, also known as a hydatidiform mole, occurs when a non-viable fertilized egg implants in the uterus. However, fertilization itself is not a necessary condition for the development of a molar pregnancy.\n\nIn a normal pregnancy, fertilization typically occurs in the fallopian tube, and the resulting zygote undergoes several cell divisions before implanting in the uterus. However, in the case of a molar pregnancy, the fertilization process is often incomplete or abnormal.\n\nThere are two types of molar pregnancies: complete and partial. Complete molar pregnancies occur when a single fertilized egg (diploid) implants in the uterus, while partial molar pregnancies occur when two fertilized eggs (triploid) implant.\n\nIn the case of a complete molar pregnancy, fertilization can occur before implantation, but it's not a requirement. The fertilized egg can implant in the uterus without undergoing the normal process of development, resulting in a non-viable pregnancy.\n\nIn the case of a partial molar pregnancy, fertilization typically occurs before implantation, resulting in a triploid zygote. This can happen when two sperm fertilize a single egg, or when a single sperm fertilizes an egg that has already been fertilized by another sperm.\n\nIn summary, while fertilization is not a necessary condition for the development of a molar pregnancy, it can occur before implantation in some cases.

It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma.

It is characterized by a range of physical and developmental abnormalities, and is often associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer.\n\n**Causes and Genetics:**\n\nBWS is caused by a deletion or mutation in the chromosome 11p15.5 region, which is responsible for the regulation of growth and development. This region contains several genes that are involved in the development of the fetus, including the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene. The deletion or mutation can lead to an overexpression of IGF2, which can cause the characteristic features of BWS.\n\n**Physical Characteristics:**\n\nPeople with BWS often have a range of physical characteristics, including:\n\n* Macroglossia (enlarged tongue)\n* Hypertelorism (wide-set eyes)\n* Macrocephaly (large head size)\n* Overweight or obesity\n* Short stature\n* Omphalocele (a protrusion of the intestines through the navel)\n* Congenital heart defects\n* Renal abnormalities\n\n**Developmental Delays:**\n\nChildren with BWS often experience developmental delays, including:\n\n* Delayed speech and language development\n* Delayed cognitive development\n* Delayed motor skills development\n\n**Increased Risk of Cancer:**\n\nBWS is associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer, particularly Wilms tumor (a type of kidney cancer) and hepatoblastoma (a type of liver cancer). Other cancers that are more common in people with BWS include osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\nBWS is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and genetic testing. Genetic testing can identify the deletion or mutation in the chromosome 11p15.5 region.\n\n**Treatment:**\n\nThere is no cure for BWS, but treatment can help manage the associated symptoms and complications.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Inherited forms of dementia:**\n\n1. **Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD):** This is a rare form of Alzheimer's disease that affects people under 65. It's caused by mutations in the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes. If you have a family history of EOAD, you may be at higher risk.\n2. **Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD):** This is a rare form of Alzheimer's disease that affects people in their 40s or 50s.

The causes are complex and multifactorial, involving a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.\n2. **Vascular dementia:** This type of dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, often due to a series of small strokes or changes in blood vessels.\n3. **Lewy body dementia:** This is a progressive disorder characterized by the buildup of abnormal protein clumps called Lewy bodies in the brain.\n4. **Mixed dementia:** This is a combination of Alzheimer's disease and another type of dementia, such as vascular dementia or Lewy body dementia.\n\n**Can one develop dementia without inheriting it?**\n\nYes, it is possible to develop dementia without inheriting it. Many cases of dementia are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, such as:\n\n1. **Age:** The risk of dementia increases with age, especially after 65.\n2. **Lifestyle factors:** Poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and social isolation can contribute to cognitive decline.\n3. **Medical conditions:** Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and stroke, can increase the risk of dementia.\n4. **Head trauma:** Severe head trauma, such as a concussion or a brain injury, can increase the risk of dementia.\n5. **Infections:** Certain infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, can cause dementia-like symptoms.\n\nIn summary, while there is a genetic component to some types of dementia, many cases are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.

Both Fildena and Viagra are used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in men.\n\nHere's how they work:\n\n**Mechanism of Action:**\n\nIn healthy men, the penis contains a type of gas called nitric oxide, which is released in response to sexual stimulation. Nitric oxide triggers the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a molecule that relaxes the smooth muscle in the penis, allowing blood to flow in and causing an erection.\n\nHowever, in men with ED, the ability to produce or respond to nitric oxide is impaired. PDE5 inhibitors like Fildena and Viagra work by blocking the action of an enzyme called phosphodiesterase type 5, which breaks down cGMP. By blocking this enzyme, these medications allow cGMP to accumulate, prolonging the relaxation of smooth muscle and increasing blood flow to the penis.\n\n**How Fildena Works:**\n\nFildena, specifically, is a generic version of sildenafil, and its mechanism of action is identical to Viagra. It is available in various strengths, including 50mg, 100mg, and 150mg.\n\nWhen taken orally, Fildena is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it binds to PDE5 receptors in the penis. This binding blocks the action of phosphodiesterase, allowing cGMP to accumulate and causing an erection in response to sexual stimulation.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\nWhile Fildena and Viagra are similar, there are some key differences:\n\n* Fildena is generally less expensive than Viagra.\n* Fildena may have a shorter duration of action, requiring more frequent dosing.\n* Fildena may have fewer side effects, such as headaches and stomach upset, compared to Viagra.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* Both Fildena and Viagra should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n* These medications are not suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain medical conditions, such as heart problems or liver disease.\n* It's essential to follow the recommended dosage and usage instructions to minimize the risk of side effects and ensure effective treatment.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how Fildena works and its similarities to Viagra!"], "inference_time": [13.468044757843018], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.6102, "rouge1_r": 0.0984, "rouge1_f1": 0.1694, "rouge2_p": 0.2414, "rouge2_r": 0.0384, "rouge2_f1": 0.0662, "rougel_p": 0.4915, "rougel_r": 0.0792, "rougel_f1": 0.1365, "bleurt": 0.3346, "bert_score_p": 0.7957, "bert_score_r": 0.8528, "bert_score_f1": 0.8232, "hallucination": 50.0, "comprehensive": 80.0, "fluency": 0.1392}]}

{"Question": "Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?", "Free_form_answer": "Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome, is present at birth and not progressive.", "Diagnosis of trisomy 13 usually involves clinical examination at birth, prenatal screening, and a karyotype test to identify the extra copy of chromosome 13."], "Nice_to_have": ["Symptoms for Trisomy 13 often include heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without a cleft palate, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia).", "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), high-resolution ultrasound during pregnancy, and diagnostic tests like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can also aid in the diagnosis of trisomy 13."], "sample_predictions": ["24\n\nYou are a helpful assistant.user\n\nIs trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?assistant\n\nTrisomy 13, also known as Patau syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 13.

Here are some current findings regarding causation, treatment, and therapy for children with KTS:\n\n**Causation:**\n\n1. The exact cause of KTS is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to a genetic mutation or a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n2. Research suggests that KTS may be associated with mutations in the PHOX2B gene, which is involved in the development of the neural crest.\n3. Some studies have also suggested a possible link between KTS and other syndromes, such as Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome with limb abnormalities (KTLWA) and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome with limb abnormalities and cardiac anomalies (KTLWCA).\n\n**Treatment:**\n\n1. **Surgical intervention:** Surgical removal of the port-wine stain (PWS) is often performed to improve the appearance and function of the affected limb. The goal of surgery is to remove the PWS and improve the overall appearance of the limb.\n2. **Laser therapy:** Laser therapy is a non-invasive treatment option that uses high-intensity light to destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the PWS. This can help reduce the size and appearance of the PWS.\n3. **Compression therapy:** Compression therapy, such as compression stockings or sleeves, can help reduce the swelling and discomfort associated with varicose veins.\n4. **Physical therapy:** Physical therapy can help improve the range of motion and strength of the affected limb, as well as reduce the risk of complications such as joint deformities.\n5. **Pain management:** Pain management is an essential aspect of KTS treatment. Medications such as pain relievers, muscle relaxants, and nerve blocks can help manage pain and discomfort.\n\n**Therapy:**\n\n1. **Speech therapy:** Speech therapy can help children with KTS develop communication skills and address any speech or language difficulties.\n2. **Occupational therapy:** Occupational therapy can help children with KTS develop fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and daily living skills.\n3. **Physical therapy:** Physical therapy can help children with KTS develop gross motor skills, balance, and coordination.\n4. **Psychological therapy:** Psychological therapy, such as counseling or psychotherapy, can help children with KTS and their families cope with the emotional and psychological aspects of the condition.\n5. **Support groups:** Support groups can provide a sense of community and connection for children with KTS and their families.\n\n**Current research:**\n\n1. **Gene therapy:** Researchers are exploring the use of gene therapy to treat KTS by targeting the PHOX2B gene.\n2. **Stem cell therapy:** Researchers are investigating the use of stem cells to repair or replace damaged tissue in KTS.\n3. **Immunotherapy:** Researchers are exploring the use of immunotherapy to reduce the size and appearance of PWS.\n\nIt's essential to note that each child with KTS is unique, and treatment plans should be tailored to their individual needs and circumstances.

This can lead to more severe enzyme deficiency and increased risk of related health issues.\n\n**Potential health implications:**\n\nResearch suggests that the A1298C mutation may be associated with various health problems, including:\n\n1. **Increased homocysteine levels:** Elevated homocysteine levels, a byproduct of impaired MTHFR activity, have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia.\n2. **Folate deficiency:** Reduced MTHFR activity can lead to inadequate folate conversion, potentially causing folate deficiency, which can contribute to various health issues, such as anemia, fatigue, and neurological problems.\n3. **Neurological disorders:** Some studies suggest a possible link between the A1298C mutation and an increased risk of neurological disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.\n4. **Cancer risk:** Some research suggests that the A1298C mutation may be associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as colon, breast, and prostate cancer.\n\n**Long-term prognosis:**\n\nThe long-term prognosis for individuals with the homozygous MTHFR A1298C mutation depends on various factors, including:\n\n1. **Genetic counseling:** If you have a family history of the mutation, it's essential to discuss your individual risk with a genetic counselor.\n2. **Diet and lifestyle:** Maintaining a balanced diet rich in folate, vitamins, and minerals, as well as a healthy lifestyle, may help mitigate the effects of the mutation.\n3. **Supplementation:** Some research suggests that supplementing with 5-MTHF, a form of folate, may help alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of related health issues.\n4. **Regular monitoring:** Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help monitor your health and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\nIt's essential to note that the scientific understanding of the A1298C mutation is still evolving, and more research is needed to fully understand its implications. If you have concerns about the A1298C mutation or its potential effects on your health, consult with a healthcare professional or a genetic counselor for personalized guidance."], "inference_time": [18.281917572021484], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.6562, "rouge1_r": 0.0446, "rouge1_f1": 0.0835, "rouge2_p": 0.2258, "rouge2_r": 0.0149, "rouge2_f1": 0.0279, "rougel_p": 0.5312, "rougel_r": 0.0361, "rougel_f1": 0.0676, "bleurt": 0.3824, "bert_score_p": 0.7925, "bert_score_r": 0.8546, "bert_score_f1": 0.8224, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.0456}]}

Here are the main types of diabetes:\n\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)**:\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. As a result, the body is unable to produce enough insulin, and people with T1D need to rely on insulin injections or an insulin pump to control their blood sugar levels.\n\nEffects on the body:\n- High blood sugar levels can damage organs and tissues, including the kidneys, eyes, and nerves.\n- Increased risk of infections, particularly in the feet and legs.\n- Weight loss, fatigue, and increased thirst and urination.\n\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)**:\nType 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance, where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin. Over time, the pancreas may also produce less insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. T2D is often associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet.\n\nEffects on the body:\n- High blood sugar levels can damage organs and tissues, including the kidneys, eyes, and nerves.\n- Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney disease.\n- Weight gain, fatigue, and increased thirst and urination.\n\n3. **Gestational Diabetes (GDM)**:\nGestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, usually in the second or third trimester. It is caused by hormonal changes and insulin resistance, which can lead to high blood sugar levels.\n\nEffects on the body:\n- High blood sugar levels can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy, such as preterm birth and stillbirth.\n- Increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.\n- Weight gain, fatigue, and increased thirst and urination.\n\n4. **LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults)**:\nLADA is a type of diabetes that shares characteristics of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. However, unlike type 1 diabetes, LADA often develops in adults and may progress slowly over time.\n\nEffects on the body:\n- High blood sugar levels can damage organs and tissues, including the kidneys, eyes, and nerves.\n- Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney disease.\n- Weight gain, fatigue, and increased thirst and urination.\n\n5. **MODY (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young)**:\nMODY is a rare form of diabetes that is caused by genetic mutations that affect insulin production. It typically develops in young adulthood and is often mild, with blood sugar levels that are not as high as those seen in type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n\nEffects on the body:\n- High blood sugar levels can damage organs and tissues, including the kidneys, eyes, and nerves.\n- Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney disease.\n- Weight gain, fatigue, and increased thirst and urination.\n\n6. **Secondary Diabetes**:\nSecondary diabetes is a type of diabetes that is caused by another medical condition or treatment, such as:\n- Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)\n- Pancreatectomy (removal of the pancreas)\n- Certain medications, such as steroids and certain psychiatric medications\n- Cushing's syndrome (a hormonal disorder)\n\nEffects on the body:\n- High blood sugar levels can damage organs and tissues, including the kidneys, eyes, and nerves.\n- Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney disease.\n- Weight gain, fatigue, and increased thirst and urination.\n\nIt's essential to note that each type of diabetes has its unique characteristics, and the effects on the body can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the condition."], "inference_time": [22.27174711227417], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5321, "rouge1_r": 0.1345, "rouge1_f1": 0.2147, "rouge2_p": 0.1484, "rouge2_r": 0.0373, "rouge2_f1": 0.0597, "rougel_p": 0.3269, "rougel_r": 0.0827, "rougel_f1": 0.132, "bleurt": 0.3592, "bert_score_p": 0.8181, "bert_score_r": 0.8613, "bert_score_f1": 0.8391, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.1719}]}

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["You are a helpful assistant.user\n\nHow does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?assistant\n\nTrisomy 7, also known as trisomy 7p or 7q, is a rare genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of the long arm (q) or short arm (p) of chromosome 7.

This narrowing can restrict blood flow, leading to increased pressure and workload on the heart.\n\nThere are three main types of aortic stenosis:\n\n1. **Calcific aortic stenosis**: This is the most common type, where calcium deposits build up on the valve leaflets, causing them to become stiff and narrow.\n2. **Congenital aortic stenosis**: This type is present at birth, where the valve is not fully developed or is malformed.\n3. **Acute aortic stenosis**: This type is sudden and severe, often caused by an injury or infection.\n\nSymptoms of aortic stenosis may include:\n\n* Chest pain or discomfort\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Dizziness or lightheadedness\n* Palpitations\n* Coughing or wheezing\n\nIf left untreated, aortic stenosis can lead to:\n\n* Heart failure\n* Cardiac arrhythmias\n* Sudden cardiac death\n\nIf you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's essential to consult with your doctor. They will perform a physical examination, take a medical history, and may order imaging tests (such as an echocardiogram or CT scan) to diagnose AS.\n\nTreatment options for aortic stenosis depend on the severity of the condition and your overall health. These may include:\n\n* **Medications**: To manage symptoms, slow disease progression, and reduce the risk of complications.\n* **Surgery**: To widen the valve or replace it with an artificial one.\n* **Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)**: A minimally invasive procedure where a new valve is implanted through a catheter.\n\nIf you're diagnosed with aortic stenosis, it's crucial to work closely with your doctor to develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs. In some cases, lifestyle modifications, such as:\n\n* **Exercise regularly**: To improve cardiovascular health and reduce symptoms.\n* **Maintain a healthy weight**: To reduce the strain on the heart.\n* **Manage stress**: To minimize the impact of stress on the heart.\n* **Avoid smoking**: To reduce the risk of complications.\n\ncan help manage symptoms and slow disease progression.\n\nRemember, early detection and treatment can significantly improve outcomes for individuals with aortic stenosis."], "inference_time": [13.898003101348877], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.6923, "rouge1_r": 0.3197, "rouge1_f1": 0.4374, "rouge2_p": 0.2381, "rouge2_r": 0.1096, "rouge2_f1": 0.1501, "rougel_p": 0.3254, "rougel_r": 0.1503, "rougel_f1": 0.2056, "bleurt": 0.2843, "bert_score_p": 0.8328, "bert_score_r": 0.8853, "bert_score_f1": 0.8582, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.3413}]}
