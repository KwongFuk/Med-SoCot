Drosprirenone is known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein throbmosis (DVT). DVTS is caused by blood clots that form in the deep leg veins, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism. The risk for DTSV is increased in women who smoke, have a family history of VTE, or have other risk factors such a obesity, certain cancers, immobility, pregnancy, surgery, etc. It is important to be aware of these risks and to take steps to prevent DTSV, such by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, wearing compression stockings, getting regular exercise, avoiding long periods of immobilization, using non-hormonal methods of birth contro,l and seeking medical attention if symptoms of DTVS occur. Ocela is a combination of two hormones, ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone. Drosprirenone is an antimineralocorticoid that can reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. However, it can also increase the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein throbosis (DVT). The risk is increased in women with a history of VTE, smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease and other conditions. The use of Ocellla should be carefully monitored in these patients. Long-Form Answer Ocelas is orally administered contraception that consists of ethinyloestradol (EE) and Dropsireneone (DR). DR is antimineralocoricoide that reduces the chance of developing endomitrial carcinoma. DR can increase risk to develop venus thombosis, VT, that includes DVP. VTP is developed by clotting of blood in deep venues, like deep thigh veines. This can cause serious problems like embolema. There are some risk factor that increase chance to VTV, for example smoker, family hystory of thomosis or other diseases, being obese, having diabetis, high blood pressure, cancer, long immobile period, use non hormal methods to control birth, age over 40, taking steroids, hirsuitism and using orals contracepion. If you have any of this risk you should take precautions to avoid VVP, by having health life style, wear compression socks, do regular exercises and avoid long period of being immovable.

Long answer essa: The No 01 Cause of Death in Preterm Infants is Different from that in Full-Term Babies because the former is caused by a lack of nutrients and oxygen, while the latter is due mainly to infections. Preemies are born too early and have not had enough time to develop their organs and systems. As a result, they are at a higher risk of dying from infection or other complications.

The fertility of a woman is determined by the number of follicles in her ovaries. A maturation of oocytes is necessary to produce a pre-mature pregency. Fertilisation of a human egg does not have a specific time frame. The process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days. However, it is important to note that fertility is not the only factor that determines whether or not a woman will experience a mole pregancy. Other factors such as age, health history, lifestyle choices, etc. can also play a role in determining the likelihood of developing a mola pregency Fertilisation of the egg is not a prerequisite for the development of a mole. In fact, the mole is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) that occurs when the placenta develops abnormally and invades the uterine wall. GTD can occur in the absence of fertility, and the exact mechanism of its development is still unclear. However, it is believed that the abrupt loss of pre-implantation embryo may trigger the formation of GTN.  The exact timing of this event is unknown, but it may occur before or after the embroyo is implanted in utero. It is also possible that it occurs after implantion, as the trophy may continue to grow and invade the maternal tissue. Long-Form Answer Fertility in women is defined as a number or folicles in their ova. This number is usually between 10 and 20. When a folicle matures, an oocyst is formed. If the ooestrus is fertile, then the fertalization process will begin. Once the process is complete, pregency will occur and a baby will be born. There are many factors that can affect fertality in a women. These include age and health. Some women may be more fertle than others. For example, women who are over 40 may have more follices than those who ar under 50 years old. Additionally, some women have health problems that may affect their fertlity. One such problem is polio. Polio is an infectious disease that affects the nervous system. Women who have polo are more likely to have fertilty problems. Another factor is listerning. Listening is when a person listens to a sound and then makes a decision about what the sound is. People who listen to sounds more often are likely more to be fertel than people who don't listen as much. Finally, smoking is another factor. Smoking can cause problems with fertillity in both men and women, so it'ss important for both partners to quit smokin if they want to conceive.

Long answer essa: The No 01 Cause of Death in Preterm Infants is Different from that in Full-Term Babies because the former is caused by a lack of nutrients and oxygen, while the latter is due mainly to infections. Preemies are born too early and have not had enough time to develop their organs and systems. As a result, they are at a higher risk of dying from infection or other complications. Full term babiess, on th other hand, are healthy and well-developed. Their orgas and system are fully functioning and they have no problems getting enough nutrition and air.

{"Question": "I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.", "Free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood.

H2O2 is a strong oxidizing agent and can cause severe burns. 2. It is highly corrosive and should be handled with care.  3. Always wear protective gear such as gloves and goggles when handling H 4. Store H in a cool, dry place away from heat and flame.   5. Dispose of unused H by diluting it with water and pouring it down the drain. Long-Form Answer Hydroxyl peracetic acid (H202) is used as a disinfectant and oxydant. The chemical is also used in the production of organic perchlorates. However, H is toxic and corrodes metallic surfaces. Therefore, the chemical should not be used without proper protection. If you are using H, you should wear glove and eye protection to avoid contact. You should also wear a respirator to protect your lungs from inhaling the vapor. After using the H , you must dispose it properly. There are several ways to dispose H . One way is by mixing it in water. Another way to get rid of it safely is through a chemical reaction. This reaction will produce water, oxygen, carbon dioxides, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, chlorine, fluorine and hydroxysulfate. These products are safe to use in your home or workplace.

It is important to take precautions to prevent the spread of shigles, such as wearing gloves and masks and practicing good hygiene. Shingrix is a vaccine that is recommended for people aged 60 and older to prevent shigella infection. Shingle is caused when the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivates in people who have had chickenpox.

These antigens are associated with a variety of clinical manifestations, including thrombosis, pregnancy complications, vasculitis, neurological disruptions, reno-vascular disease and atherosclerosis. Despite the significant impact of APS on patient health and quality of life, research on this condition is limited, with only a few studies focussing on the underlying mechanistic pathways. The lack of research may be due to a lack understanding and awareness of this syndome, as well as a limited understanding the pathophysiology and clinicopathological features of APs. Antiphospholpid syndromes are rare autoimmune disorders that can cause blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. They are often associated with other auto-immunediseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The exact cause of these syndroems is unknown, but they are thought to be causedby an abnormal immune response to phosphatidylserine, a phospolipd found in cell membranes, which can lead to clotting. Due to their rarity and the complex nature of their causes, research into antiphopholid syndrone is limited. Anti-phospholpid syndromes are rare and difficult to diagnose, which may contribute to a lack of research. Additionally, the condition is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, making it challenging to study in isolation.

Calcitriol nasale is a medicinal product that contains calcipotriene, a synthetic form of vitamin D3, which is used to treat psoriasis. It is important to follow the storage instructions on the packaging to ensure that the medications remain effective and safe to use. According to FDA guidelines, calcium nasalen should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. If the product is not stored properly, it may lose its potency and effectivity. In addition, the nasspray may not be effective if the temperature is too high or too low, as this can affect the stability of the active ingredients. Therefore, if an opened, non-refigered calciteon nasaspray is stored according to manufacturer's instructions, its effectivness should not differ significantly from if re-fridgerated.

It works by increasing blood flow to certain areas of your body, including the penis. Fildan is not a cure for erection problems, but it can help you achieve and maintain an erections. Filden is a phosphodiesterase type 6 (PDE6) inhibitor that works by increasing the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) within the corpus cavernosum of men. This leads to increased blood flow and relaxation of smooth muscle cells, resulting in an erection. Fildana is similar to Viagara in its mechanism of action, but it is not a selective PDE5 inhbitor like Viagar. Instead, it works on both PD5 and P6. Filden is a generic version of Viagara. It is used to treat erectile dysfunction in men. Filedena contains sildanefil, which is an active ingredient that helps to increase blood flow to your penis. When you are sexually aroused, the blood vessels in your genitals expand, allowing more blood to flow into your erection. Sildanafil helps this process by relaxing the muscles in the walls of your blood vessel.  This allows more oxygen-rich blood into the penile tissue, resulting in an erections.

{"Question": "Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?", "Free_form_answer": "Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body.

Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13.

One of their most popular uses is to relax muscless and help people sleep better. This is because quinergic receptors are found on many muscelss and nerves in our bodies. When these receptorss are activated by quinas, they cause the body to release chemicals that make us feel relaxed and calm.This is why quina is often used before bedtime to promote sleepiness. Another use for quinea is as an anti-anxiety medicament. Anxieties are often caused or worsened by stressors in life, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and panic.

In conclusion, quiness may be effective for treaing leg pains and spams, but more research is needed to confirm this. Long-Form Answer Quinines are medications that are commonly used by people to help them relax and sleep. These medicines can also be found as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Some of the most common quins are quetiapine, lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, gabapentin, clonazapam, zolpidem, trazodone, alprazolam and zaleplon.Quines have been around for a long time and have many different uses. One of their most popular uses is to relax muscless and help people sleep better. This is because quinergic receptors are found on many muscelss and nerves in our bodies. When these receptorss are activated by quinas, they cause the body to release chemicals that make us feel relaxed and calm.This is why quina is often used before bedtime to promote sleepiness. Another use for quinea is as an anti-anxiety medicament. Anxieties are often caused or worsened by stressors in life, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and panic.

When taken together, they can interact and cause adverse effects. It is important to be aware of potential interactions and to consult a healthcare professional before taking medication with alcohol. Medications and alcohol can interact in various ways, including altering the absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, toxicity, efficacy, adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, etc. of each other. The effects of alcohols on medicines can be classified into three categories:  (1) Alcohol increases the bioavailability of some medicinal drugs, such as antibiotics, antifungals, anti-inflammatory dru, analgesics and antipyretics. (2) The bioactivity of other medicaments, like anticoagulants, hypoglycemic agents, sedatives, anesthetics is reduced by alcoho.l (3) Some medicament, for example, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, disulfiram, methadone, are contraindicated with alcohole.  In general, the effects are dose-dependent, so the risk of adverese effects is higher with higher doses of medicinals and higher alcohal intake. In addition, some druggs may be contra-indcated or have a reduced effect when taken with certain alcohold. For example: (a) Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is contraindiated when combined with ethanol. This is because acetamino-phen is metaboized to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which is toxic to liver cells. Ethan-ol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P45O, which catalyzes the formation of NAP-Q1. Therefore, when etha-nol and aceta-minophene are combined, NACPQl is formed in excess, leading to hepatotoxicity. However, if acetalamin-ophone is taken 8 hours after ethanal, it is safe. So, taking acetic acid with a small amount of wine is not a problem, but taking it with large amounts of ethyl alco-hol is dangerous.

Insuline is produced by the pancreas. The panrease is located in your stomach. If the mother has a diabetes, the baby will have a high chance of having a hypoglicemia. Hypoglcemic new borns are caused when the mother has diabetes during pregancy. The mother can avoid this by taking care of her diet and blood sugar levels. Hypolactasia is a genetically determined condition that causes a deficiency of the enzyme lactase, which is necessary for the digestion of lactic acid in milk. It is estimated that 3-5% of new-born babies have hypolac-tasia, and this condition is more common in certain ethnic groups, such as those of Asian or African descent. Hypomelanotic nevi are small, dark spots on the skin that occur in people with hypopigmentation. They are usually found on areas of skin exposed to sunlight, but can also be found in areas that have not been exposed. These spells are caused by a lack of melanin, the pig-ment that gives skin its color. Melanocytes, cells that produce mel-anins, are found throughout the body, with the highest concentration in the epidermis. When melanosomes, small organelles that contain melani-n, move from melano-cytes to keratinocyte cells, they are transferred to these cells via a process called melas-mation, resulting in a darker coloration of these keratino-cites.

Long-Form Answer Metforin is used for the treatment of diet-controlled type II dibetes mellietus, which is also known as non-insulin-dependent dibeitic melleitues. This is one of the most common forms of mellenitue. In this type of disease, your body does not use insuline properly. Insulene is needed to convert glucose into energy. When your pancreas doesnot produce enough insuine or any insule at all, gluose builds up in your blood. High blood gluce levels can cause many health problems. Long term health complications include heart disease and stroke. Your doctor may prescribe metforine to improve your bodys response to insulen. You may need to take metforein along wit other dibete medicines. Do not take this medicine if you are allergic to metorein or similar medication. Before taking this medicne, tell your doctor if: you have liver or kidney disease; you hae a history of heart attack or stroke; or you hav a thyroid disorder. Tell your docter about all prescription, over-the-counter, nonprescription medicnes, vitamins, herbal prodedures, or dietyary supplements you take. Some medicenes can interact with metorine and cause a serious condition called lactic acidosis,which is fatal. Lactic acidois is more likely to occur if your kidneys are not working well.

{"Question": "What is the likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child?", "Free_form_answer": "Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.

Long form Answer: Noctuarl enureis (NE) or bedwetting is involuntary urination during sleep. NE is common in childhood and usually resolves by adolescence. In adults it may indicate a medical problem.NE is more common among boys than girls. About 15% of children wet the bed at least once a week. Most children who wet their bed have a family history of NE. Children with NE may have other problems such a sleep disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disordere (ADHD), or anxiet.Children with ADHD are more likely to wet bed. Other causes of bed wetting include urinary tract infection, constipation and bladder infections.There are many treatment options for NE, these include behavioral interventions, medicin, bladdder training, bed alarm, desmopressin and surgery.Behavioral Interventio: Behavior intervention is one of most common treatment for bed-wetter.

They can also help to relieve pain and stiffness. Some common NSADs include ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, indomethacin and celecoxib. Analgesic medicals are also often used for pain relief in arthereitis cases. Common analgetics include acetaominophin (Tylenol), aspirin , and paracetamol (acetaaminofen).

Treatment for artheriosclerois typically involves lifestyle changes, medicament, surgery, angioplasty, stenting or bypass surgical operation.Lifestyles changes that can aid in reducing the chance of artritis include eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a normal weight, not smoking, limiting alcohol intake, managing stress levels, getting enough sleep, avoiding sitting for long periods of time, wearing comfortable shoes that support the feet and legs, using proper posture when standing or sitting, taking breaks from activities that cause pain or disability, seeking medical care if the condition waxes worse or does not improve with lively changes.Medications that may be prescribed to treat arthuritis pain include non-sternal antiinflammatories (such as ibuprofen), analgesics (like acetaminophen), musculoskeletal medicinals (including corticosteroids), antidepressants (for neuropathic artyritus), and anticonvulsants. Surgery may also be an option in some cases, particularly if there is significant nerves damage or if other treatmets have not been successful.Angioplastery is another option for treament of leg arthyrits. It involves inserting a small balloon into the affected artry and inflating it to widen the blood vessel. Stents may then be placed to keep the vessel open. Bypass surgicery is an alternative to angiplastering in cases where the blockage is too severe or where there are multiple blockages in different arters.Both angioptasty and bypas surgary are invasive procedures that carry risky, so they should only be considered as a last resort. If the above treatements do not provide relief, then the next step is usually to consider medicating.There are several medicants that are used to treate artheitis, depending on its cause and severeness. Nonstearen anti inflammation medicators ( NS AID s) are often the first line of therapies for mild to moderate cases of oartheitis. These medicates work by reducing inflamation and swollening. They can also help to relieve pain and stiffness. Some common NSADs include ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, indomethacin and celecoxib. Analgesic medicals are also often used for pain relief in arthereitis cases. Common analgetics include acetaominophin (Tylenol), aspirin , and paracetamol (acetaaminofen). Musculuskeleton medicins are sometimes used as well, as they can reduce inflation, swellings and help relie pain . Corticosteriods are commonly prescribe for muscular skeletons arthis. Antidepresants are another type of medicant that is sometimes prescribes for neurological arthes.Anticonveptants may likewise be use to help treat neurethic oarthitis . Sleeping pills may sometimes be recommend to aid with pain management.If the oathitis is severe, other medicats may need to be consider. For example, if a patient has rheuma toid arthers, they may require medicat that target the immune system. Other medicin that could be considers include antibiotics, antivirals, immunosuppressants, biologics and steroids . In some case s, patients may even need surgically to remove the inflamed tissue or to replace a damaged joint.Question: How can I treat my leg cramps?

These chemicals are known as neurotransmitters, which are responsible for transmitting signals between nerve cells. By increasing their levels, Wellburtrin helps to improve mood and reduce symptos of depresion. Additionally, It also helps in treating anxieties and panic disorder. Wellbuitrin is available in two forms: immediate-release and extended-released. Immediate-relase Wellburytrins are taken orally and are absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. Extended-Release Wellbytrines are designed to release the medicine slowly over time, providing a steady level of medicaton in your blood. Both forms of this medicatin are available as table, capsules, or oral solution.https://www.homeworktutorshive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hthlogo.png 0 69 89 https://pharmacy24h.net/p2h/functional-analysis-of-the-wellbutrine-xl-145-m-longform-answer/ \u00a9  | Powered by HomeworkTutorShive"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.3143, "rouge1_r": 0.1096, "rouge1_f1": 0.1626, "rouge2_p": 0.0288, "rouge2_r": 0.01, "rouge2_f1": 0.0149, "rougel_p": 0.2, "rougel_r": 0.0698, "rougel_f1": 0.1034, "bleurt": 0.3135, "bert_score_p": 0.774, "bert_score_r": 0.8227, "bert_score_f1": 0.7976, "hallucination": 0.0, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.1846}]}

Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["Trismy 6 is an autosomic chromo-somic abnor-mality that is characterized by an additional copy (3 instead 4) of the short arm of Chromos-ome number 5.

This condition is caused by inflammatory changes in the connective tissue of muscular and skeletons. These changes can lead to pain in muscels and bones. There are many symptons of FMS, including waking up tired, feeling tired all the time, pain that is worse in morning, difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying aslep, restless sleep, unrefreshing sleep. Some people also experience depressions, mood swings, memory problems, brain fog, dizziness, numbness or burning sensations in hands and feet.FMS is usually diagnosed by a doctor after ruling out other possible causes of pain. A doctor may also order blood tests to rule out conditions that cause similar symptos. If FIBROMYALGIA is diagnose, treatment may include medications, physical therapy, exercise, massage, acupuncture and other therapies.Question: How does Fibrmyalgica cause pain? Long form Answer: Fibermyalgia is chronical pain disease, which is cause by musclular and connectivet tisue inflmation, it is also called fibrotic myalgias. Symptoms include wake up feeling exhausted, tiredness all day, morning pain worse than other times, difficult to fall aslee, stay aslpe, have restles sleep and unrefreshed sleeping. Other symptms include depresion, moody swinngs and memory problem.

This is because seronine can interfere with the production of nitric oxide, an important chemical that helps to relax the blood vessels and increase bloodflow to your penile area. As a result, this can make it difficult for you to achieve or maintain an erection. In addition to E D, other common sideeffect of using EfeXoR include: nerve damage, weight gains, nasea/vomiting and diarreah. It is important to note that not everyone who takes EFEFEOR will experience these symptoms.

Long form Answer: Noonen' syndome is characterized by a variety of physical abnormities, most notably a short neck, weberism (wide-set eyes), and a heart defect. Other features may include a small head, low-lying ears, short arms and legs, underdeveloped genitals, abdominal wall defects and/or a cleft palate. No one knows the exact cause of Nooen' Syndeome, although it'ssuspected to have genetic origins. Some researchers believe that it may be causedby a mutation in one or more genes that control the development ofthe heart and kidney. Others believe it could be due tounregulated growth of cells in these organs.
