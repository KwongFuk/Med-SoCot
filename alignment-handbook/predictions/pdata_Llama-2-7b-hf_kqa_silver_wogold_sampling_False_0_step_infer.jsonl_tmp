{"Question": "Two questions: why only treat the symptoms when by the time you know its severe its too late?", "Free_form_answer": "This question seems to focus on the approach of treating symptoms rather than underlying causes of diseases. Generally, healthcare professionals aim to treat both symptoms and causes where possible. However, there are some conditions, especially chronic or progressive conditions, where management of the symptoms plays a significant role in improving the quality of life even if the underlying cause cannot be fully addressed. The severity or progression of a condition doesn't always equate to it being 'too late'. Although symptom management may be more prominent in advanced stages of certain diseases, it is often part of an overarching treatment plan designed to control the disease, slow progression, enhance life quality, and extend survival. Immediate symptom relief can also be crucial in situations where failure to do so could be life-threatening or cause irreversible damage.", "Must_have": ["It's important to note that healthcare professionals aim to treat both symptoms and causes wherever possible.", "Sometimes managing symptoms plays an essential role, especially when the underlying cause can't be fully addressed, for instance, in chronic or progressive diseases."], "Nice_to_have": ["Symptom management may be more prominent in advanced stages of certain diseases, making up an overarching treatment plan aimed at controlling the disease, slowing its progression, enhancing life quality, and prolonging survival.", "It's also important to note that immediate symptom relief can be crucial in situations where it could prevent a potentially life-threatening scenario or possible irreversible damage."], "ICD_10_diag": "COVID-19", "sample_predictions": ["The symptome is only a sympton of an underlying disease, not a cured.

However, without specific information about the type of illness or condition you're referring to, it's difficult to provide the period during which someone is contagious. Different illnesses have different contagious periods. For instance, the common cold is usually contagious for a few days before symptoms arise and continues to be contagious as long as symptoms are present, typically for about a week.

While it has been shown to be safe and effective in treating all types of allery, its use during breastfeeding has not been well studied.

In general, antihypertensives are considered to have a low risk of affectin breastmilk supply, with the exception of some beta blockers which can decrease supply by as much as 50%. Claritten is considered a first-generation antihypertenstive, meaning that it works by blocking histaminergic receptors in order to reduce inflammation. Histamene is released during an allertic reaction and can lead to symptoms such aas sneezing or itching skin. By blocking the receptor, Clarittin helps to prevent these symptom from occurring while still allowing the body to produce histame. This is why Claritte is often used as a treatment for allersy symptons such asthma or hay fever. When it comes to breast feeeding mothes who are taking Claritein, the jury is still out on whether or not it will have an effect oon milk suppl.

Therefore, breastfed infanrs should be monitored closely for any adverse effects. 1. Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial infections. 2. Macrolide drugs can cause a decrease in breast milk production, which may be due to their effect on the hormones that regulate milk supply.  3. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any medication while breast-feeding, as the potential benefits and risks should be carefully weighed. Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial infections.

These sideeffects may affect the supply of breast milk, so it is important to monitor the baby's feeding and weight gain. If the mother experiences any of these side effectss, she should consult her doctor to determine if she needs to stop breast feedi Long-Form Answer Claritine is one of the most commonly prescribed anti-hystamines in the United States. While it has been shown to be safe and effective in treating all types of allery, its use during breastfeeding has not been well studied. There are some concerns that Clariten may decrease milk output, however, this has yet to been proven. In general, antihypertensives are considered to have a low risk of affectin breastmilk supply, with the exception of some beta blockers which can decrease supply by as much as 50%. Claritten is considered a first-generation antihypertenstive, meaning that it works by blocking histaminergic receptors in order to reduce inflammation. Histamene is released during an allertic reaction and can lead to symptoms such aas sneezing or itching skin. By blocking the receptor, Clarittin helps to prevent these symptom from occurring while still allowing the body to produce histame. This is why Claritte is often used as a treatment for allersy symptons such asthma or hay fever. When it comes to breast feeeding mothes who are taking Claritein, the jury is still out on whether or not it will have an effect oon milk suppl.

It is also known as hay fever or all seasonal rhinitis. The most common symptoms are sneezing, itching of eyes and nose, runny nose and itchy eyes. Pollen is one of many all year round allers. Recent studies have shown that pollination of plants can be affected by climate change. For example, the polinization of ragweed in North America has been shown to be more frequent in warmer years. This is because warming temperatures cause the plants to produce more polen. In addition, warer tempertures can also cause polens to become more allergeic.

The pelvis is made up of muscle and connective tissue that supports the organs in your lower abdomen. When you tense your scleras, you are putting pressure on these musculoskeletal structures, which can lead to pain. Additionally, the pelvic muscular system is connected to your bladder and bowel, so when you have pain in this area, it can also affect your ability to urinate or have a bowl movement. Tensing the sclera can cause pain and inflammation in people with scleroderma. This is because the condition causes the body to produce too much collagen, which can lead to stiffness and tightness in muscles and tissues. The increased pressure on the blood vessels can also contribute to pain. Additionally, the inflammatory response caused in part by the immune system can further exacerbate the symptoms.

{"Question": "Could I have a topical antibiotic?", "Free_form_answer": "A topical antibiotic is a medication that is used to treat local infections on the skin. It works by eliminating the bacterial infection present on the skin, which helps to reduce inflammation and allow the skin to heal. Whether or not you would be a good candidate for a topical antibiotic depends on several factors including the nature and extent of your skin condition and your overall health status. Other factors to consider are your medical history, any allergies you may have to medication, and any other medications you are currently taking.

Antiparasitic agents are sometimes used together with antiretroviral medicational products to control HIV in people who have not responded to other antirheumatic medicants. Question: Can I use top applied medicinals for my skin? Long form Answer: Top applied Antifibrinolytic is an anticoagulant that prevents the breakdown of fibrins. Fibrous proteins are important for blood clotting. When fibration is broken down, it can cause bleeding. This is why top application antithrombotic are commonly used after surgery to stop bleeds. There are many different types of Antithrobotics, but they all work in a similar way. Most anticlotting medicates are taken by pill or injected into the bloodstream. But some antidote are top applicated. For example, heparin is given intravascularly (into a blood vessel) to thin the clots that form after a heart attack or stroke. Heparins work quickly and are very effective at preventing clottings. Other antimetabolites are injectable and must be administered by a health care professional. Examples of these antitoxins include warfarin and enoxaparin. Warfarins and other Antimetabole are antagonistic to vitamin K, which is needed for clothing. Without vitamins K in your body, you would bleed easily. Enoxoparin is also an Anticoaguant. Like warfins, enoxtoparins prevent cloting by blocking the action of vitmain K.

{"Question": "what about antibiotics?", "Free_form_answer": "Antibiotics are drugs that are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. They work by killing the bacteria or preventing them from spreading and reproducing. It's critical that antibiotics are taken as prescribed by your healthcare provider, since misuse of these drugs can lead to antibiotic resistance, where bacteria evolve to become resistant to the drugs designed to kill them. If you miss a dose of an antibiotic, it's generally recommended to take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. In that case, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Remember, you should never take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

Antibacterial resistance can be caused by genetically acquired resistance, such as mutations in the biosynthetic pathway of antioxidant enzymes, or by acquired mutation, which is acquired through exposure to antiseptics or antifungal agents, resulting in a decrease in antigenicity. The antigens are the target of immune responses, so the antagonism of these antagons is also the cause of resistance.  1. Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern in the medical field. 2. It is important to understand the mechanics of antimicrobial resistance in order to develop effective strategies for combating it.  3. There are several factors that contribute to antifungal resistance, such as the use of broad-spectrum antiviral agents, the emergence of new strains of bacteria, and the development of resistance genes. 1.

Question: what is post nose draping? Long form Answer: Post nose drips are the result of excessive masturbation, which can cause the nose to become dry and irriated. Mastubation can also cause a person to have a dry mouth and nose, as well as an increased risk of developing a sinuplasty. A sinuplasty is when a surgeon removes the lining of one or more ofthe sinusses in order to relieve pressure on them. Sinusplasts are often performed on people who have had a previous sinoplast, but they canalso be performed as part of an initial sinosplas.Postnasals are caused in a variety of ways, from allerties to inhaled irratants. They can occur in both children and adults, although they are most common in children. Most people with postnosals will experience them for a short period of time, usually a few days or weeks. But some people may experience post nosals for months or even years. What are postnoals? Postnosal drippings are mounds of thick, sticky mold that form on your skin. These molds are usually found on areas of skin that are exposed to sunlight, like the face, neck, arms, legs, hands, feet, chin, cheeks, nose or ears. How do post noals form? The most likely cause for postnostalgia is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light is found in sunshine and artificial light sources like fluorescent bulbs and tanning beds. When UVB rays from the sun hit your body, they cause your cells to produce melanin. Melanocytes are cells that produce pigment, so when they produce too much pink, your face will turn red. Your skin will also become more sensitive to UVA ray, making it more prone to developing post nostalgic moulds. Why do people get post nodals on their skin? There is no one answer to this question. People who get them may have different reasons for getting them, depending on what they do and where they live. Here are some of those reasons: - People with darker skin are at a higher risk for developing them because they have more melanosomes (pigments) in their cells. Darker skinned people also tend to get more sun exposures than lighter skined people. So if you're a dark skinner, be sure to wear sunscreen when you go out in public. And if your job requires you to work outside, make sure you wear protective clothing.

Some baterial are good for us, while others can make us sick. When bakteria grow out of control, they can invade other parts of your body and cause infectious diseases. Antibiotics kill bactoria by interfering with their ability to grow, multiply, reproduce, etc. There are many different types antimicrobials, including antiviral, antiparasitic, antiinflammatories, immunosuppressants, analgesics, anesthetics and antineoplastics. Each type of antmicrobiotic works in a different way to kill or prevent the spread of bactory. For example, some antbacteriall agents kill the bacticla by preventing them from making proteins or by blocking their growth. Others prevent bacillus from multiplying by destroying their cell walls or blocking the production of new cells. Still others prevent them by killing them or stopping them form reproducing.information: Nasal cones and sponges can be used for nasolabial flap reconstruction. Nasolabsial Flap Reconstruction is performed to reconstruct the soft tissure of nasoalabia, nasofacial fistula, nose defects and nasosinus fractures. A nasoseptal flaps is created by elevating the skin and subcutaneous tisure from the lateral nasoturbinate and the septum. Then, this fap is rotated and advanced to cover the defect in soft-tissue.

{"Question": "Can i replace Naproxen by paracetamol", "Free_form_answer": "Naproxen and paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) are two different types of over-the-counter pain relievers and both vary in their spectrum of activity. Naproxen belongs to the group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which implies it not only relieves pain but also reduces inflammation and lowers fever. Paracetamol is known to be excellent at relieving mild to moderate pain and reducing fever, but it does not have anti-inflammatory properties. Hence the substitution of these two really depends on the type of pain and its cause that you are treating. It is important to remember that each of these drugs come with their own set of potential side effects and risk factors, and so, it\u2019s always recommended to use them under the supervision of a healthcare professional.", "Must_have": ["Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that relieves pain, reduces inflammation and lowers fever, while paracetamol only relieves mild to moderate pain and reduces fever, but has no anti-inflammatory effects.", "Switching between these two drugs must only be done under the supervision of a healthcare professional due to potential different side effects and risk factors associated with each medication."], "Nice_to_have": ["The substitution of naproxen with paracetamol or vice versa depends on the specific type and cause of pain you are treating.", "Both medications are available over-the-counter and are widely used to manage various types of pain and discomfort."], "ICD_10_diag": "Gastritis, unspecified, without bleeding", "sample_predictions": ["Napraxin is one of the most commonly used nonstereotypical antiinflammatories (NASID).

The drug is available in different forms, including tablets, capsules, oral suspension, topical gel, suppositories, eye drops, nasal sprays, injectable solutions, intravenous infusions, rectal supplements and inhalers. In addition to its anti inflamtory properties, NAPROXEN has also been shown to have analgetic and antipyretic effects. Napsrogen is usually well tolerated by most patients, with the exception of those who have a history of asthma or allergies. Some people may experience side effect such a stommach pain or diarrhea.

Paracitamal is also an analgesic drug, but it is not an NSAID. It is often used as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate pain. Both drugs are available over-the-counter and can be used for a variety of conditions. However, Naprosen may be more effective for certain types of pain, such as arthritis, while paraceamel may work better for headaches or muscle aches. Additionally, parceamale is less likely to cause stomach upset or other side effects than Naprose. Therefore, it may not be a good choice for people who are sensitive to NSAIIDs. Ultimately, the choice between Napropen and parcaetemal depends on the individual's specific needs and preferences. Paracitamal is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Naprosyn is an NSAIA that can be used for the same purposes. However, paraceptamole is generally considered to be a safer option for long-term use, as it does not have the potential side effects of naproxyne, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney damage. Additionally, it is less likely to interact with other medications and has fewer drug interactions. Therefore, in most cases, naprosine should be replaced by Paracytamale.
