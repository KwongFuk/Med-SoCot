{"Question": "And how does Genital herpes and HPV differ?", "Free_form_answer": "HPV infections and genital herpes are sexually transmitted infections that are caused by different viruses and have distinct clinical presentations.\n\nGenital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).

Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer. HPV is spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection.

Muscle Relaxants are medications that help to relax the muscles and reduce muscular tension. They are commonly used to treat conditions such as spasticity, musculoskeletal pain, spasms, cramps, tics, tremors, dystonia, myoclonus, rigidity and other involuntary movements. Muscle spasm is a common symptom of many medical conditions, including multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury.  Muscular relaxants can be classified into two main categories: centrally acting muscarinic receptor antagonists and centers acting non-muscarinergic anticholinergenic agents. Centrals acting antimuscarine agents work by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is involved with muscule contraction. Non-centrall acting agents, on the othe hand work directly on musclular tissue to reduce tonicity. Examples of central acting relaxers include benztropine, trihexyphenidyl, biperiden, diphenhydramine and atropin.

{"Question": "Are lutein and omega 3 good for vision ?", "Free_form_answer": "Lutein is a carotenoid compound which is available in green leafy vegetables (kale, broccoli, spinach, lettuce, and peas), along with other foods, such as eggs, pistachios, and corn. Lutein is found in high concentration in the retina, which is the light sensitive area of the eye. Studies have attributed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and blue light-filtering effects to lutein. The studies suggest that lutein may protect against and reduce the severity of many eye diseases. By reducing damage to the retina, lutein may enhance vision in both normal and diseased eyes.\nDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found naturally in fish, is also found in the retina.

Question: Please recommend an anti-inflammatory for a patient with sinustitis.Long Form Answer: Sinustis are small air spaces located in bony cavities of skul and face that are connected to nasolarynx. Their function is to humidify and warm the inspired air. Air enters the nostrils and passes through a narrow passageway called the ostium. Then it enters a larger space called a meatus. From there, air passes into the paranasal cavity. Paranasals cavaties are divided into four groups: maxillary, ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid. Each group has its own sinous cavitiy. Maxillar cavitis are located behind your cheekbones. Ethmoid cavatis are found between your eyes. Frontal caviats are in front of each eye. Spheniod cavati are behind each of you eyes and above your nasals. All of them are separated by boney walls. Inside each cavaty is mushy tissue called mukous. Mukus is made up of cells called ciliated epithelium and goblet cells. Goble cells produce muckus that is secreted into cavatys. As air moves through cavitys, mukyus are moved out of cavatsys and into nasoalarynxs. Nasal muckyus then drain into your throats. Your throts then pass the mukeyus to your larynges where they drip into you trachea. Tracheas then carry mukeys to lunges were they can absorb oxygen. Mukeys are then exhaled from your lunges into air and out your nostril. You can get sinusta when your mukius become inflected. An inflection is inflammed mummy. Inflections can happen when mumyus get inflicted by virues or by fungi. Most inflections are caused viruss. Common viruse that infect mumiy are rhinoviruses. Rhinovirus is very common and can affect anyone. People who have weak immun system are more likely to get rhiovrus. Children are also more like to have rhoivrus because they have weaker immunity. Adults who smoke are at higher risk of getting rheovus because smoking weakens immuniy system and makes it easier for rhenovuus and other viruses to inflict mummies and sinuta. To treat inflecions, you can take antihistamines. Antihystamins are drugs that block histimine receptors. Histimines are chemicals that make mimy cells contract.

Question: How does Noonean Syndrome affect the kidneys? Long form Answer: Noonaan syndrom is a genetic disorder that affects many different parts ofthe body, including the heart, face, hands, feet, kidney,and reproductive organs. Nooan is caused by mutations in the PTPN11 gene,which is located on chromosome 4. This gene encodes a protein called SHP2, whic is involved in cell signaling and growth. Mutationsin the gene can lead to abnormally high levels of STP2 in cells, wich can disrupt normal cell function and cause a variety of symptomsthat are characteristic of Nooaan. One of these symptons is renaldysfunction. Renal dyssfunction is common in people with Noaan, but the exact mechanism by which it occurs is unknown. Some studies have suggested that Noan may cause renals to develop abnorally, leading to a higher risk of renalfailure. Others have found that people wiht Noana may develop renaltubular acidosis, in which the renas are unable to excrete acids properly. Still other studies havesuggested that renall dialysis may become necessary in severe cases ofNoaana. Overall, more research is needed to understand the full extent ofrenal function in Noaaan and how it contributes to overall health.Answer 5:information: Banans contain a high amount of potashium which is essential for the proper functioning of our body.Potashim helps in regulating the fluide balance in our bodies and also helps with the bowl movement.Bananas contain fiat which also plays an important role in keeping our bowls regular.Fiat also absorbs water which makes the stoo soft and easy to move.The sweet taste of Banannas also makes it easy for us to digessthe food.However, Bananna is high on sugar content and this can wreak havoc on our diabetics patients."], "inference_time": [3.2785263061523438, 2.8582773208618164, 4.901244640350342, 17.87155795097351], "all_output": ["Bananas are rich in potassium, which helps to regulate the body's fluid balance and maintain normal bowel movements.

Potassim is important for muscle contraction and nerve function, and can be depleted by dietary restrictions and diuretics. Banana can also help replenish the fluid lost due to diarahee. However, it is not recommended to eat banana if you have diabetes, as it can increase blood sugar levels. It is also important to note that bananan can cause gas and bloating in some people, so it may not be suitable for everyone. Long-Form Answer Bananans are often recommended as a home remedy for diariahe. They are known to be high potaasim, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, folate, magnesium and manganese.

Low thyroxine levels can cause weight loss, but high levels may cause the opposite effect. Thyrotoxicosis, a condition characterized by high thyrotropin levels, can lead to hypermetabolism and weight reduction. However, hypothyroidism, which is characterised by low levels of thyroglobulin, may result in weight increase. Low thyroxine levels can contribute significantly to obesity, as it can lead individuals to feel lethargic and less inclined to exercise. Additionally, low levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) can cause a decrease in the production of TSH, which is necessary for the release of the thyroglobulin that is used to produce thyronine. As a result, the body may not be able to properly metabolize food, leading to an increase in body weight. Low thyroxine levels can contribute significantly to obesity, as the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is responsible for stimulating the production of thyroglobulin, a protein that is essential for the synthesis of the heme group in thyronine. When TRH levels are low, the body is unable to produce enough thyrosine, leading to a decrease in metabolic rate and an increase in body weight.

HVR is typically measured by electrocardiography (ECG) and is used to assess cardiac function and detect abnormalities. Heartrate, on the hand is measured using a pulse oximeter or a stethoscope. Hrv is a measure of the variation in heartbeat intervals, while heartrate is simply the number of beats per minute. Hrm is measured by electrocardiography, which records the electrical activity of heart muscle, whereas heartrates are measured using a stethoscope or a pulse oximeter.  Analyzing Medical information:  The relationship of HVR and heart rates is that Hvr is an indicator of cardiac function, and it is used to assess the health of a patient's heart. Heart rate is not a direct measure, but it can be used as a proxy for Hvm. Analysing medical Information Hrv is a measure of the variation in heartbeat over time, while heartrate is simply the number of beats per minute. Hrm is typically measured using an electrocardiogram (ecg), while hr is measured by a pulse oximeter or a heart monitor.

When the urusio comes in contact with the skin, the body reacts by producing histamines. Histamins are chemicals that cause the alligic reaction. These chemical are released in response to an allergen. An allergan is anything that causes an alligeric response. Allergens can include pollin, food, medicines, chemical, animal dander, mites and insect stings. In the United States, poison plants are found throughout the country. They are most commonly found on west coast. There are three types poisoned oils. Western poison oil is most toxic. Eastern poison is less toxi. Southern poison has the least toxis. Symptoms of an aligerc reaction include itchin, redness, burning, hives, wheezing and swollen lips. Treatment for an ailgeric rasection includes taking an over the counter anti histaminic medicatins. Anti histimins block the histomines from binding to histome receptors. Some anti hisimens are available over-the-counter. Others are only available by prescription.

The test may also be used to diagnose thy ectom y.Thy roids are produced in two ways: by de novo synthesis and by conversion of T4 to T3. De nov o synthes is by enzymes in thy oid cells, whereas conversion is catalyzed by monooxygenase enz ymes in liver and kidney. T2 is formed from T1 by iodo t ransferase in peripheral tissues. Both T and T are transported to target tissue by binding to thy reo globulins (TBG).T4 andT2 are the main thy orones in ser um. They are measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) or by immunoradiometric assay. In RIA, antibodies are used as markers for T or T.

It works by relaxing the blood vessels, reducing the workload of your heart and lowering your bloodpressure. The effects of lisiopriol are usually seen within 2 weeks. Lispropril is a medicinal drug that is used to treat high blood sugar. The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyne (ACE), which is responsible for the production of angiotenin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels and increases blood flow. By inihibiting ACE, lispiril helps to relax the blood vessel walls and reduce blood volume, which can help to lower blood glucose levels. Lisinipril is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressures. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, which helps to lower blood flow. Lisinipril is usually taken once a day, and it can take up to two weeks for the medications to take effect. If you are taking Lisipri, it is important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly and to follow your doctor's instructions. Lisinipril is a medication used to treat high blood pressures. It can take up to 2 weeks for the medications to take effect. If you are still experiencing high BP, you should consult with your doctor. Long-Form Answer Lisinipril is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines for high Blood Pressure (BP). It is also used in the treatment of heart failure and kidney disease, as well as in some other conditions. However, Lisopir is not a cure for BPH, but it does help reduce the symptoms of BHP. In this article, we will discuss the benefits of Lisino, how it works, the side effects, dosage, precautions, interactions, warnings, etc.Lisinipril is available in two forms: oral tablets and injections. Oral Lisine is taken by mouth, while inhalation Lisina is given as an injection into the muscle. Both forms are effective in reducing BHB.The benefits Lisniprill: Lisnipir helps reduce BPP by reducing blood clotting and increasing blood circulation. This helps prevent heart attacks and strokes. Additionally, Lisiprilla helps improve kidneys function by increasing the amount of urine produced. Finally, Lipsinil reduces inflammation in joints and muscles, making it easier to move around.How Lisprin works: Lispin is made up of two parts: an active ingredient called Lisapril and a placebo. When taken together, these two ingredeints work together to reduce Blood pressure. Lissaprilla works on two levels: first, by blocking the action of enzynes that cause blood to clump together; second,by increasing circulating levels of nitric oxide (NO), a gas that helps relax bloodvessels. Side effects: The most common side effect of Liso is dizziness or lightheadedness. Other possible sideeffects include headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation, muscular pain, fatigue, drowsiness, dry mouth and throat, blurred vision, difficulty urinating, increased urination frequency, decreased appetite, weight loss, hair loss and skin rashes (especially on your face). Dosage: For adults, take one tablet every day with food or as directed by your healthcare provider. For children ages 6-12 years old, give one 10mg tablett every other day or every 4 hours as needed. Precaution: Do not take Lispiri if you have any of these conditions: heart disease; kidnys disease (including diabetes); liver disease or cirrhosis; high cholesterol levels; asthma; allergies; pregnancy; breastfeeding; or if your child has any all of theses conditions (see below). Interactions: There are no known interactions between Lisna and other medicin.

Long form Answer:Iburofen and Tyloene are both non-steryoid anti -inflamma -tory dru -gs ( NS AID S). They work in different ways. Iburofene in-hibits the synthesis of prosta-gla-ndins. Prosta -g-la -ndin is produced by the prostate gland and is involved with the inflama- tion process. By in -hib -it -ing the produc-ti -on of this h -orm -one, the pain is reduced.Tyloe -ne inh -ib -its an en -zym -e called cytochrome P450. Cyto -chrome -P4 5 0 is found in li-ver cells and it is responsible for the breakdown of ac -et -a -min -oph - en. Inhibition of cy -to-chrome- P 4 -5 -0 results in an increase in ac-et-a-mino phen levels in blood.Ac -eta -mi -no -ph -ene has analgesic and ant -i -pi -na -ti-ve properties.It is important to note that iburofene and ty -lo -nen are not the same.

Long form Answer:Iburofen and Tyloene are both non-steryoid anti -inflamma -tory dru -gs ( NS AID S). They work in different ways. Iburofene in-hibits the synthesis of prosta-gla-ndins. Prosta -g-la -ndin is produced by the prostate gland and is involved with the inflama- tion process. By in -hib -it -ing the produc-ti -on of this h -orm -one, the pain is reduced.Tyloe -ne inh -ib -its an en -zym -e called cytochrome P450. Cyto -chrome -P4 5 0 is found in li-ver cells and it is responsible for the breakdown of ac -et -a -min -oph - en. Inhibition of cy -to-chrome- P 4 -5 -0 results in an increase in ac-et-a-mino phen levels in blood.Ac -eta -mi -no -ph -ene has analgesic and ant -i -pi -na -ti-ve properties.It is important to note that iburofene and ty -lo -nen are not the same. Question: How does ibutrofen work? Long Form Answer(More than355 words)Ibutropfen (IBU) is classified as non steroid, anti \u2013 infl ammat ory drug, (NASID). It works in two ways: by decreasing the amount of substance P, an inflaming substan ce, in nerve cells, as well as by preventing prostoglandi n synthase from producing prostoga ndi ns. NASID\u2019S are often prescrib ed for ar thritic pain as they are less likely to cause gastric ulc eration as compared to asp irin and coxibs, however, they can still cause ulcera tions. There are many types of NAS ID\u2019 S, some of which have been withdrawn from market due t o safety concerns. For example, Vioxx (rofecoxib) was with drawn from mark et in 9/2010 due its association with increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Additionally, some people may have a higher tolerance for pain or may experience other symptoms that mask the pain of an infected area. Abscesses can be painful or painless, depending on their location and size. Pain is often associated with absesses in soft tissues, such as the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, tendons, ligaments, bursae, joints, fascia, lymph nodes, organs, blood vessels, nerves, etc. However, some absceses, especially those in bones, can occur without pain. This is because the pain receptors in these areas are less sensitive to pain, so they may not be able to detect the presence of an infection. In addition, the inflammatory response in some areas may be suppressed, which can also lead to a lack of pain sensation. Yes, it is common for an infected wound to be painless.
