So it's important that you seek immediate medical help. 1. Febrile Seizures are not harmful in themselves, but they can be a sign of an underlying medical condition that may require further evaluation and treatment. 2. It is important to monitor the child's temperature and ensure that it does not rise too high, as this can increase the risk and severity of fevers. Febrile Seizures are not harmful, but they can be frightening for parents. They are usually brief and do not cause any long-term problems. However, if a child has multiple fevers or seizure episodes, it is best to consult a doctor. 1. If the child has a history of fevers and seizure, the doctor should perform a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause. 2. The doctor may recommend a neurological examination to assess the brain's function and rule out any structural abnormalities. Long-Form Answer ebrile convulsions are the most common type of seizural disorder in childhood. These seizual episodes are often associated withe fever, which is why they're called febre seizals.

Stress can lead to a decrease in saliva production, which can cause dryness in your mouth and increase the risk of developing mouth sores. Additionally, stress can also weaken your immune system, making it more difficult for your body to fight off infections that may leadto mouth sore development.

Mouth ulcer is a common condition that can be caused due to various factors. Stress is one of the potential causes of mouth sores. When a person is under stress, the body releases hormones that increase inflammation and reduce the immune system's ability to fight infections. As a result, mouth lesions can develop. 2.

{"Question": ",Can an extra rib cause problems?", "Free_form_answer": "Having an extra rib is a congenital condition known as cervical rib. It is fairly uncommon, but it can potentially cause problems by compressing or irritating surrounding structures, the most problematic being the brachial plexus and the subclavian vessels that pass into the arm. Compression or irritation to these vital structures can lead to a condition known as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Symptoms of TOS can include pain in the neck and shoulder, numbness and tingling in the fingers, and a weak grip. However, not everyone with an extra rib experiences these symptoms or any discomfort; the condition can sometimes be asymptomatic. If symptoms become problematic, they can often be managed with physical therapy, pain management techniques, or surgical removal of the extra rib in severe cases.", "Must_have": ["Having an extra rib can potentially cause problems like thoracic outlet syndrome.", "Symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome can include neck and shoulder pain, numbness and tingling in fingers, and a weak grip.", "If symptoms become a problem, they can often be managed with physical therapy, pain management techniques, or surgery in severe cases."], "Nice_to_have": ["Not all individuals with an extra rib will experience discomfort or problems.", "An extra rib is a congenital condition known as cervical rib, and it can sometimes be asymptomatic."], "sample_predictions": ["n extra, superfluous, accessory, additional, supplementary, surplus, spare, redundant, non-essential, unnecessary, dispensable, gratuitous, unneeded, unwanted, undesirable, pointless, useless, worthless rib may cause pain and disfigurement."], "inference_time": [3.118863344192505, 4.3639585971832275, 2.0739574432373047, 2.377040147781372], "all_output": ["1.

However, if the deformation is severe and causes pain or difficulty in walking, surgery may be required to correct the condition. Surgery involves realigning the bones of leg and fixing them in place with metal rods or plates. Recovery from surgery can take several months and may require physical rehabilitation. Long-Form Answer owed Legs can occur in children due a variety of reasons. It can either be a congential deformaty or a developmental one. Congenital bowleggedness is caused by a malformation of the femur or tibia. This can happen due an injury during pregnancy or due genetic factors. Developmental bow-leggness occurs due the growth of a child' s bones. As the bone grows, the ends of it become more rounded. These rounded ends can cause the leg to bend inwards.Bowlegs can usually be fixed by physical therapies. Physical therapy can help to strengthen the muscles around the knee and ankle. Stretching exercises can improve flexibility and range-of-motion. Braces can provide support to help the joint align properly. Sometimes, surgury may also need to be done to realine the tissues and bones around knee."], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4046, "rouge1_r": 0.3926, "rouge1_f1": 0.3985, "rouge2_p": 0.0462, "rouge2_r": 0.0448, "rouge2_f1": 0.0455, "rougel_p": 0.1832, "rougel_r": 0.1778, "rougel_f1": 0.1805, "bleurt": 0.3057, "bert_score_p": 0.8461, "bert_score_r": 0.8636, "bert_score_f1": 0.8548, "hallucination": 16.666666666666664, "comprehensive": 100.0, "fluency": 0.5604}]}
