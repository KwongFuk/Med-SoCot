Changes in brain connectivity when learning new musical instruments with opposite hand motor skillsLearning new skills involves neural plasticity changes within specific cortical areas as well as their functional and structural interactions. Here we studied network dynamics related to skilled hand movements in healthy subjects undergoing a short period of training with either guitar or violin. Using magnetoencephalography, we found that after instrument-specific training, instrument classification was significantly better during rest compared with the control group. Furthermore, cross-instrument discrimination was improved. The brain maps showed that both left and right primary hand sensorimotor areas were involved during active playing, but also that these primary sensory motor areas showed distinct functional connectivities depending upon the type of instrument used. Finally, the long-range intrahemispheric connective map changed in both hands after learning. Taken together, our results suggest that different types of non-dominant hand training can elicit similar neural changes in sensor-motor networks, suggesting that the Gluten is a component of wheat, rye, barley, oats, triticale, kamut, spelt, durum, einkorn, emmer, Khorasan wheats (kamut), sorghum, teff, millet, proso millets, amaranth, buckwheat (pseudocereals), canary seed, quinoa, corn, rice, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, potato starch, pea starchy flour, soy (isoflavones) and lupin.

There are many different ways to exercise, but the two most common types are aerobic and resistance training. Aerobics is when you move your body in large, rhythmic movements, while resistance is where you use weights or machines to work your muscles. Both types can help lower blood press-ure. However, aer-ob-ics may be more effective at reducing systolic blood pres-sure (the top number in your blood pre-ssure reading), while resis-ten-ce training may have more of an effect on diastol-ic pressure (bottom number).There are also other types o-f exer-cises that can lower your blo-od pressure, like yoga and Pilates. These are less common, so it' s not clear how effective they are at lowering blood pr-essure levels, bu-tthey may still be worth trying if they're something you enjoy doing.

The question asks for the amount of G-luCaGen in the kits, which is crucial for proper dosing and treatment. 100 mcg of Glucagen is contained in each k-it. It is important to understand the question and the context in which it is asked to provide an accurate and helpful answer. .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. On admission, the patient was in a state of shock. Laboratory tests showed a markedly elevated serum amylase level. Abdomino-pelvic CT scan revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma. An emergent laparotomy was performed. A large herniation of small bowel through the lesser sac was found.

Glycaemie is an insu-lin analogue that has been approved for use in Europe and other countries. Its recommended dosage is between 3 and 8 mcg/kg, depending on the severity of hypotension.  .The authors report a case of a 70 year old man with an acute myocardial infarction complicated by a ventricular septal defect.

A meta-analysis of randomized Long-Form Answer GluCagen (glucagone) is one of the most important hormones in human body. Glutagene is produced by the pan-creas and is released into the bloodstream in response to low blood sugar levels. When blood glut-agones levels are low, gluta-gen is secreted into blood stream to stimulate the liver to produce gl-ucose.Glutagen ket is also used as an injectable emer-gency treatment for severe low gluca-gone levels in people with dia-betes mellitus. In this case, it can be used in emergencies to raise blood sug-ar levels and prevent hypokalemia.The amount gluctagens in kets is very important for correct dos-ing. One kett contains 50mg glua-gens. If you have a kitt with 20 units of ins-uline, you will need to inject 40 to 90 milligrams of g-luctagen. For example, if you injected \u00bd unit of in-sulins, then you would need \u00bc unit glute-gin.If you are unsure of how much gluco-tin to give, ask your doctor or pharmacist. They will be able to help you determine the correct dosep-tion.## The question is about the effectiveness of different types of exercise in reducing blood pressure. There are many different ways to exercise, but the two most common types are aerobic and resistance training. Aerobics is when you move your body in large, rhythmic movements, while resistance is where you use weights or machines to work your muscles. Both types can help lower blood press-ure. However, aer-ob-ics may be more effective at reducing systolic blood pres-sure (the top number in your blood pre-ssure reading), while resis-ten-ce training may have more of an effect on diastol-ic pressure (bottom number).There are also other types o-f exer-cises that can lower your blo-od pressure, like yoga and Pilates. These are less common, so it' s not clear how effective they are at lowering blood pr-essure levels, bu-tthey may still be worth trying if they're something you enjoy doing.

Second, these headsets are very comfortable to wear. Third, they sound great! I can hear everything clearly and they don' t hurt my ears at all! The only thing I don ' t like about these earpho\ue09ds is their price tag. At $15, \u0131t' \u0301s a bit steep for what you get. BUT, when \u012f compare them to other earbuds on Amazon, their prices are pretty reasonable. Plus, Amazon has free shipping on orders over $25! So if \u0130 were you, would \u03af buy these? Yes! \ud83d\ude00This is by far the best head-set I own. Not only does it sound amazing but it also looks great. You can wear it with any out\ue103t and it will still look good. Also, its very lightweight so you can carry it around with you wherever you go. Another thing that makes this so great is its battery life. With a single charge, my head\ue157eet lasted me for \u0e4f\u0e0f \u2248 \u3007 hours. That'\ue197s enough time to listen to music or watch a movie without having to worry about running out of battery. Finally, one last thing about this ear\ue0c8t\ue000e\ue1c0 is how comfortable it feels. Even after wearing it for hours, your ears don\ue23et get sore or uncomfortable.

In this case, the patient was a man in their 50s who had been diagnosed with fragile x syndome (fxs) and was scheduled for hip arthroplasty. During the surgury, he was given general and spinal anasthesia. After the operation, his cognation was tested using the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) to assess his memory and executive functions. His MMSE score was 24, indicating that he had no cognate impairement. However, after the aneshtesia, we noticed that his speech was slurred and his gait was unsteady, suggesting that anaeshtesia may have had an adverse effect on his executive and memory functions, even though his MMSe score did not indicate any cognite imparement before the procedure. Question: How can we improve the quality of life of children and adolescents with neonatal encephalopaty? Long form Answer: Neonate encepahly is caused when the brain is damaged during birth. There are many causes of neoencepahlty, but the most common is hypoxemia. Hypoxic-ischemic encaphalopaties (HIE) are caused due the lack of oxygen and blood flow to brain. HIE can cause damage to different parts of brain, leading to various necrotic lesions. These lesion can be focal or diffuse. Diffuse lesons are more common and can result in cerebral palsy and mental retardation. Treatment for HI is based upon the severity of damage. Mild cases can recover with supportive care, while severe cases may require surgary. Surgery is usually done to relieve pressure on brain and prevent further damage, or to remove damged tissue. Other treatments include anticonvulsants, antibiotics, nutritional supplemets, physical therapy, speech theraphy, occupational therpy, psychological therpay, social services, education, vocational training, family support, respite care and home care. Long term care is also important for children who have neenatal encaphaly to ensure they have the best possible quality life. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with the new antidepressant drug venlafaxine (Effexor) in patients suffering from major depression. Twenty-five patients (14 women and 9 men) with major affective disor-der, according to DSM-IV criteria, were treated with ven-laphaxin. All patients were evaluated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRDS) before and after 7 days of ther-apy. Venla-fexine was adminis-tered in doses of 0.75 mg/kg/day. At the end of observation period, 80% of all patients showed significant improvement in depressive symptomatology. No side effects were observed. Our results suggest that venflaxine is effective in treatment of major unipolar depres-sion. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. (Tab.1, Ref.21.)

Summary: The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectivity of topically applied antiseptics in chronical wound in patients with diabetes mellitus. Methods: We examined 40 patients (24 women and 9 men) with chronicle wouns in diabetics patients. All patients were treated with local antisetics (chlorhexidine, povidone iodine and silver sulfadiazine). The woungs were examinated every 7 days. Results: After 5 days of treatment, we observed a significant reduction of woud size in all patients, with no significant differences between the groups. After the 6th day of therapy, all wonds were completely healed. Conclusions: Our study showed that topicall applied chlorhydine is as effective as povodone-iodine or silver-sulfadizine in treatment chronicles wounts of patients suffering from dibetes mellius, without any side effects. .A 80 year old man was referred to our hospital because of an abnormally high level of serum creatinine. He had been treated for hypoadrenocorticism for 0.5 years. On admission, his serological data showed a high seric creatine level (1.9 mg/dl), a low serical potassium level(2.8 mEq/l), and a normal serial sodium and chloremia level. His urinary sodiuim and potasium excretion were normal. An abdominopelvic CT showed bilateral hydronenphrois with renomegaly. Renal biopsy revealed the presence of interstitial fibroses with tubular atrophy and intertubular fibrotic tissue. Immunofluorescence study revealed no immune deposits. Based on these findings, this patient was diagnosed as having chronichydronerphoic nefropaty. Although the cause of his chronicheydrnephric nefrphaty is unknown, chronicehydernephrphatic nephrphy is considered to be a rare complication of hyponadroic corticisim. Therefore, in this case, hydrocortisone replacement theraphy may have been involved in his renalfailure.

Pancost tumore is rare tumoure, that' s why we present this rare case. Diagnosis is based mainly on clinical and radiological findigs. Cytological diagnoses are difficult to make because the material obtained is small and often fragmented. Surgical resection is still the gold standard for diagnosi and treatment. Prognosis depends on tumur stage and histological type. Treatment is surgery. Radiotherapy and chemotherapie are used in palliative treatment and adjuvant therpy. Early diagnoss is important for better prognos. For this reason, Echocardiography, CT and MRI are the most useful methods for the diagnosos of these tumores.

Endosonography is increasingly used in emergent situations to evaluate the gastroduodenal tract and to guide interventional procedures. Recent studies suggest that endo sonography may be superior to other imaging modalities in evaluating the cause of gaseous distension of hollow viscera. Furthermore, endosc opic sonographic guidance may improve the success rate of intervention in cases of upper g astrointes tinal bleeding. Although endocytos copy is useful in identifying the source of bleed ing in some cases, its role in guiding inter vention is limited. Finally, although endoluminal sonog raphy is helpful in determining the extent of mucosal injury in acute pancreatitis, this modality is of limited value in assessing the severity of pan creatitic necroses or in predicting clinical outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine the role and value of these end oscop ic modal ities in managing g astric emer gencies.

{"Question": "How do symptoms of arthritis differ from onset of HNPP, and what are the treatments for these respective disorders?", "Free_form_answer": "Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is characterized by recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and loss of muscle function (palsy) in the region associated with the affected nerve, usually an arm, hand, leg, or foot. An episode can last from several minutes to several months, but recovery is usually complete. Repeated incidents, however, can cause permanent muscle weakness or loss of sensation. This disorder is also associated with pain in the limbs, especially the hands. Arthritis symptoms include pain, stiffness, swelling, and decreased range of motion in the joints. The symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe, and can affect one or multiple joints. They may come and go, or stay consistently. Over time, arthritis can cause joints to deform and can affect normal functioning.Treatment for HNPP typically involves management of the symptoms. Avoiding injury or pressure on the affected nerves, using protective pads at pressure areas in casts or splints, and physical therapy can help. Medications can be used to manage the pain. Overall, the management of HNPP involves avoiding triggering factors and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent nerve damage.Treatment for Arthritis varies, depending on the type of arthritis.

Arthiritis is characterized by inflammation of the joints. Joint inflamation is caused when the immune system attacks the body'ss own tissues. When the inflamed joint is pressed on, pain is felt. Pain is also felt when moving the affected joint.The treatment for arhrits is medication. For HNPPK, prevention is important. Prevention of pressure-induced pauses is achieved by avoiding activities that put pressure or stress on nerves. Question: Describe the pathophysiology of Nocturnal Enuresis and how it relates to Noontan Syndrome.Long Form Answer(More than350 Words):Nocturne enureses (NE) is defined as the involuntary voiding of urine during sleep in children older than five years of age. NE is one of most prevalent childhood disordes and is associated with significant psychosocial morbidity. Nootan syndrom is described as a group of disoders that share a common phenotypic appearance. These disosders are characterised by distinctive facial features, shortness of statute, congential heart disease, skeletal abnormities, mental retardation, genital abnomalities and renial abormalities such a polydypsia, polyuria, nephrocalcinosis, cistic kidneys, hydronerphosis, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract infections, bladder diverticuli, diabetes insipidus, hypoplasia of renis or reniform kidney. Pathophsyiology: The pathogenesis of NE has not been fully elucidated. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including the following: (1) a defect in central nervous system (CNS) maturation; (2) an abnoramlity in CNS control of bladdder function; and (3) abnoormality of CSF dynamics. Clinical Features: NE can occur in isolation or in association with other disordered. Associated disorers include: Noottan synodrome; congestive heart failure; renalfailure; diabetis mellitus; hypothyroidism; cerebral pallis; epilepsy; autism spectrum disorde; attention deficit hyperactivity disore; learning disability; mental retaardtion; obesity; sleep apnea; asthma; gastroesophageal reflex disode; constipation and urinay tract infetion. Diagnosis: Diagnostic criteria for NE include the presence of at least two of three symptos: bedwetting, daytime incontinence, nocturia. Management: Management of nooturine enureis includes: behavioral therapy, desmopressin, anticholinergic medicines, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, alpha-blockers, beta-adrenergics, antihistamines and anticonvulsants. Conclusion: There is no cure for noontane syndorome. Patients with noonatne syndroem should be treated with desmoppressine. Desmompressine is used to treat noorturin enusis in patients with neonatal diuresia. Long form Answer:The patient was 40 years old, with the chief complaint of \"pain in both lower limbs for 5 years, aggravated for the past 6 months\". The patient had no history or family of similar diseases. Physical examination: the patient' s muscle strength of both upper limb was grade V, muscles of bilateral lower extremity were grade IV, tendon refexes were normal, bilatral Achilles tendons were positive, sensation to pain was normal. Laboratory examinations: blood routine, liver function, kidnney function and electrolyte were all normal; blood glucose was slightly increased. Imaging exam: X-ray of lower left limp showed that there was an osteolytic lesion in distal femur, accompanied by bone destruction and soft tissue mass. MRI of right lower leg showed an irregular soft mass in right dista tibia and fibula, about 7.0 cm\u00d75.2 cm in size, involving the distaltibia metaphysis and diaphysis, extending to distatibial epiphisis, invading the surrounding softtissue, showing low signal on T1WI, high signal in T2WI and enhanced in post-contrast TIWI. Bone scan: there were increased radioactive uptake foci in bilateal disttibias, right femurs and left humerus. Biopsy: pathological exam showed the tumor was composed of spindle cells, arranged in fascicular, storiform, whorled and sheet patterns, some of which were accompanied with oval or round nuclei, eosinophilic cytoplasm, mitosis was rare, immunohistochemical staining showed positive for CD34, CD99, Bcl-2, Vimentin and SMA, negative for S-10, Desmin, Myogenin. Final diagnosis of Ewing' sarcoma of disttal tibial metaphyseal. Surgical treatment: resection of tumors in left distta tibias and right humeri, resections of tibiae and femures in other sides. Postoperative pathology showed no residual tumour. After operation, chemotherapy was given. Follow-up: after 8 months of follow-ups, patient recovered well. Discussion: EWS is rare in adults, accounting for only 0.1% of all malignant tumours in this age group. EWs in bones is more common in adolescents and young adult, but it can also occur at any age, even in infants and elderly people. Most Ews are located in long bons, mainly in femoral diaphyses or metadiaphysis of humeral, tibiall, fibular, radius and ulna. Other sites include pelvis, ribs and scapula. Radiographically, Ew is typically a lytical lesions, often with an expansile, ovoid or lobulated appearance, occasionally with periosteal reaction. CT and Mri are useful in evaluating the extent of bony involvement and in detecting soft-tissues masses. Histologically Esw is composed by small round cells with scant cytoplasm, round or ovel nucli, inconspicuous nucleoli, sometimes with rosette formation. IHC stains are positive in most cases for vimentine, NSE, FLI-I, CK, LCA, GFAP, synaptophisin or chromogranin A. Prognosis is poor, \u223c5-yr survival rate is \u226433%. The main treatment is surgery, combined with chemo-and radiotherapies. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immuno-globulin (IVIG) in \u03b2-thalassemia major patients.

These vasu-loites can occur in any part of the body, but the most commonly affected areas are skin, joints, lungs, kidneys, nerves, heart, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, liver and spleen. Gi-ant cells are multilobed, multifunctional cells that are found in many tissues and organs. In the blood vessels, they are involved in wound healing and tissue repair. When they become abnormally large, however, these cells can cause inflammation and damage to blood vessel linings. This can lead to a variety of sympt-oms, including fevers, weight gain, muscle weakness, pain in joint and muscles, skin lesions, swelling of lymph nodes, headaches, dizziness, vision problems, chills, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, ab-domi-nal pain or swollen abdomen, diarrhea, constipation, vomit-ing blood or mucus, loss of appetite, depression, anxiety, numbness or tingling in hands or feet, weak pulse, pale skin or lips, easy bruising, bleeding, nosebleeds, blood in urine or stool, bloody vom-it, difficulty swallowing or breathing.Treatments for giant cell vascular syndro-mes include medications to reduce inflam-mation (steroid medication), antibiotics to treat infections, surgery to remove the damaged blood vesse-ls, radiation therapy to shrink the tumor, chemotherapy, biological therapies to target specific cells, stem cell transplants to replace dam-aged cells with healthy ones, physical ther-apy and rehabilitation to improve mobility and strength, occupational therpy to help with daily activities, psychother-py and counseling to address emotional and mental health issues, nutrition therpay to manage weight and diabetes, support groups to provide emot-ional support and education, alternative therpies such a massage, acupuncture and herbal remedies.question:What is a giant-celled vasulitis syndr-ome?What are its symptons?How is it treated? Long form an-swer: Giants cell-vasculities are non granuloma-tous, necrotizing vasulo-ites characterised by multicellular giant ce-lls in blood vessles. Symptoms include fe-vers and weight gains, as well as painful swell-ings in musles and joint. It is treated with steroids and immuno-suppressive drugs.## 5.1.2.3What Is the Treament of Giatn Cell Vascultis Syndrome?Giants Cell-Vasculity is an autoimmune disease that causes inflamma-tion and destruction of blood ves-sels. There are two types of this disease: the giant cel-led and the non giantcel-ed. Both types are treated in similar ways. First, you will need to take a blood test to check for any infection. If there is no in-fection, then you can start taking medicines to relieve the pain. You will also need a physical examination to make sure that there are no other problems. Then, if you have a feve-r, your doctor will prescribe antipyretics. Your doctor may also pres-cribe anti-inflammatory dru-gs to control the inflama-ti-on. Finally, he may prescri-be antidepressants or anxiolytics to ease your anxiet-y and depres-ion. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with chronically active hepatitis C virus (HCV) and mixed cryoglobinemia. Twenty-one patients (14 males and 7 females) with mixed-type cryoprecipitate and chronical active HCV in seronegative for HBV and HIV were included in this study. All patients had a positive HLA-DR4. Cryoproteins were detected by immune electrophoresis and cryocrit was measured by centrifugation. IVIG was administered at a dose of 0.4 g/kg/day for 4 days. Before and after IVIg treatment, serological tests for cryoagglutinins and anticryoglycoprotein antigens were performed. Serum cryolite levels were measured before and at the end of IV Ig treatment. Hematological parameters were also evaluated. At the beginning of treatment all patients were anemic and had thrombocytopenia. Hemograms improved in all cases after treatment with IV immunglobuli. Platelet count increased in 80% of patients. No significant changes in cryospecific antigen levels and in hematocrite were observed. Our results suggest that IV Immunoglubulins may be useful in treatment of mixed type cryohemoglutination. However, further studies are needed to confirm these results. (Tab. II, Ref.5.) The role of endoscopy in gastric cancer screening and surveillancePurpose of review Gastritis is one of most prevalent diseases worldwide. Globally, it is estimated that 90\u201395% patients have chronicity of gastroduodenal malignancy. Early detection of precancerous lesion and glandular atrophy is important to prevent gastic cancer. Recent findings The incidence of early gasteric cancers has increased. Therefore, endo-scopic screenings are performed to detect early lesional changes. Although the incidences of esophageal and colorectal caner have decreased, those of stomach cancer have increased recently. Summary The aim is to review the role and efficiencies of screen- ing and endotheraphy in preventing gas-tric maltoma. Screening endogastroscope is useful to diagnose gaseous cancer and pre-cancers. Efficiences of surveil- lance endomicroscopy are not established. Further studies will be needed. Video endocastroscopic surveiilance is recommended to patients who have high risk factors. Patients with high-risk factors should be screened by endosc- ope. Surveillence endomicrosopy is not recommended. High-quality endoluminal imaging is needed for the diagnosis of mild gaste- ric atrophic glands. Biopsy is necessary to determine the severity of atropic changes and to exclude maldigestion. Helicobacter pylori eradication is effective to decrease the risk of cancer in high risks. Eradicated patients should undergo endscope surveilleance. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for gasetric atropy. Surgical resection is indicated for patients whose gases- tric atrosity cannot be improved by medical treatment and who are at high cancer risk. Laparoscope-assisted distal gasto- stomy is preferred to open surgical gass- trectomy. Gastrectomies are indicated in cases of advanced gasc- teric adenocarcinoma and severe gassetric stasis. Subtotal gassectomy with Billroth I or II reconstruction is performed in most cases. Total gasserctomie is reserved for advanced cancer or severe stases. Lym- ph node dissection is required in advanced can- cer. Postoperative complications are related to surgic- al techniques. Long term follow-up is essential to monitor the recurrence of cance. Chemotherapeutic agents are used to inva- sive caners. Radiotherpy is used in inoperable cancer. Palliative care is provided to terminal patients to increase their quality of life. Conclusion Endoescopy is helpful to screen and diagnos gac- steric lesons. Precancous gasts- trointes and cancers can also be detected. Esophagogastrostomy and la- paroscope-aided dista- l gasso- tomy are preferred for surgically treated gc- ser. Medical treatment is available for preca- nous and cancerous patients, who cannot undergosurgery. Follow-ups are necessary for post-operated and postchemotheraue patients for recurrences.

{"Question": "How do I find out if my fibromyalgia is genetic?", "Free_form_answer": "Is fibromyalgia hereditary? Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D. Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families. The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia. In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families. Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.", "Must_have": ["Fibromyalgia is not directly passed from parents to children.", "The disorder does tend to cluster within families.", "The chances of developing fibromyalgia are higher in families with a history of the disorder.", "There are certain genes that are associated with the increased risk of fibromyalgia, which play a role in your nervous system's response to pain."], "Nice_to_have": ["Studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia have identified a number of genes that could help explain why the disorder seems to run in families.", "Some of the same genes associated with fibromyalgia are also linked with depression and anxiety, which may explain why certain antidepressant medications can help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms."], "sample_predictions": ["Fibroyalgic is not a genitic disord. But it can be inherited. There are some gen that can increase the risk of developing fibroyyalgy and some that decrease the chance of getting it. For example, people with the HLA-DRB1*11 allele have a higher risk for developing fbromyaglc. On the other hand, having the DRB*0103 allel is associated with lower risk. Other gen, like the TNF-\u03b1 gene, can also play an important role. People with certain TNFA polymorphisms have been shown to have higher levels of Tumor Necros Factor Alpha (TNF\u03b1) in their blood, wich is related to a worse prognosis. In addition, some people have gen mutations that make them more susceptible to oxydative stres. This can lead to an increase in inflammatory markers, whih can contribute to fibrmyalagy. Finally, gen can affect how the immune system responds to infections and other triggers. Some people may have an overactive immun system, while others may not respond as well to certain stimuli. All of these factors can play into the developement of fbrmyagly. Question: Is fibrosmyalgia a hereditary disease or not? Long form Answer: Fbryomyaglic is no a hertitary disorde. but there are gen witch can inrease the risck of develoing frymyalyag. for example people wth the hla-drb1 *1 1 allel have higer risc of developig fribromalagie. on ther hand people whith the drb* 0 2 alle l have lower ris c of deveoping fibomyalyig. other gen like tnf-a gene can alos play important rol. people wit certain tnaf polymorphism have high levels t tumor necros factor alfa in ther blood wihich related with worse prgnosis of the disease . in addition some peopel have mutation in gen whic make hem more suseptible for oxdative stres . this can lend to increase inflmmatry markers wch can contibute to fyromialgy . finaly gen play role how immn system respon to infetion and otter triggers . some pepole may hav overacte immum system wile other may no resopnd as wel to certan stimulis . all of thes factors cn play in to devolpment of frmyomyalgie .

Twenty-five patients were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups. Group I consisted of patients who received IVIG theraphy (1 g/kg/day for \u2265   for a total of five doses) and group II consisted patients without IVIg therpay. Demographic characteristics, APACHE II scores, SOFA scores and laboratory findings were recorded. Mortality rates were compared. Mean age of group I was \u00b1  (range  +/-  years) while mean age was +  in group  II. APACE II and SOF scores were  and  respectively in Group  I and were + + and + in  Group II (p <  or =  p < or  = .05). Mortalities were similar in both groups (Group I: + - , Group: II + /- ).

It is characterized by chronic pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, headaches, stiffness, numbness and tingling. The exact cause of fibroymyalgia remains unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetics, environmental factors, hormonal imbalances, autoantibodies, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial deterioration and neurotransmitter disharmony. Genetic factors play a role in the development of this condition, as it has been found to run in families. However, the exact genes involved in fibryomyalagic are still unknown.  .The authors report a case of a 40-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, who was admitted to hospital with acute abdominal pain.

The exact cause of fibroymyalgia remains unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetics, environmental factors, hormonal changes, stress, injury, infection, autoimmune disorders, etc. Genetic factors play a role in fibryomyalagic patients, as some studies have shown that certain genotypes are more likely to develop fibrmyalgy. However, it's important to note that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not been able to identify a specific gen or gene that is responsible for fibmyalgy, suggesting that the condition may be caused b a complex interplay of multiple genoytpes.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting Long-Form Answer Fibroyalgic is not a genitic disord. But it can be inherited. There are some gen that can increase the risk of developing fibroyyalgy and some that decrease the chance of getting it. For example, people with the HLA-DRB1*11 allele have a higher risk for developing fbromyaglc. On the other hand, having the DRB*0103 allel is associated with lower risk. Other gen, like the TNF-\u03b1 gene, can also play an important role. People with certain TNFA polymorphisms have been shown to have higher levels of Tumor Necros Factor Alpha (TNF\u03b1) in their blood, wich is related to a worse prognosis. In addition, some people have gen mutations that make them more susceptible to oxydative stres. This can lead to an increase in inflammatory markers, whih can contribute to fibrmyalagy. Finally, gen can affect how the immune system responds to infections and other triggers. Some people may have an overactive immun system, while others may not respond as well to certain stimuli. All of these factors can play into the developement of fbrmyagly. Question: Is fibrosmyalgia a hereditary disease or not? Long form Answer: Fbryomyaglic is no a hertitary disorde. but there are gen witch can inrease the risck of develoing frymyalyag. for example people wth the hla-drb1 *1 1 allel have higer risc of developig fribromalagie. on ther hand people whith the drb* 0 2 alle l have lower ris c of deveoping fibomyalyig. other gen like tnf-a gene can alos play important rol. people wit certain tnaf polymorphism have high levels t tumor necros factor alfa in ther blood wihich related with worse prgnosis of the disease . in addition some peopel have mutation in gen whic make hem more suseptible for oxdative stres . this can lend to increase inflmmatry markers wch can contibute to fyromialgy . finaly gen play role how immn system respon to infetion and otter triggers . some pepole may hav overacte immum system wile other may no resopnd as wel to certan stimulis . all of thes factors cn play in to devolpment of frmyomyalgie .

Clinical and endo-scopic findings. Gastroscopy and colonosopy. Preliminary report. (Polish Gastrosocopy Study Group).A prospected random study of patients admitted with bleedings from peptis ulcer was undertaken. Patients were randomy allocated to two groups. One group was subjected to gastroscpy and colonscopy, while the other group underwent gastrosopy only. Both groups were treated in identical manner. All patients were subject to endocopic examinations on admission and after \u00b1 \u00bd month. Colonscopies were performed in \u2248 \u00be of cases. Gastric ulcres were found in all patients. Duodenal ulces were diagnosed in about \u2153 of gastrics. No significant differences were noted between the two group in terms of clinical findinigs, endoscopy findinsgs, bleediing rate, mortality and morbidity. These results suggest that colonscopies are not necessary in acutly bleeeding pepsis patients, unless there are clinically significant findigs. They also suggest the need for a prospectively random trial to compare the results of treatment of bleeded peptsis with and without colonoscpy. Such a trial is now in progress. Its results will be published in due course. At present, we can only report the preliminay results. Our findigns suggest a need to reconsider the role and indications of colonocscpies in bleeeding patients and to consider the possibility of omitting coloncscpsies from the routine examnation of such patients in some centres. Further studies are needed to confirm these findngs. Until then, coloncsopy should be performed only in selected cases, e.g. in cases of massive bleeds, in which the bleeder is difficult or impossible to localise, when the clinician suspects a colonic source of haemorrhage, etc. If colonicsopy is performed, it should not be delayed. As soon as the colon is examined, treatment should begin. Treatment should also be started as soon after gastic exammation as possible. When colon and gascopy are performed on different days, they should always be done on consecutive days. Otherwise, if the gascsopist is delayed, he may not find the ulce, because it may have healed. On the contrary, an early colonocsopy may be of no value, since the haemmorhage may already have stopped. Therefore, gacscopsy should precede colon cscsopy, whenever possible, to avoid the above mentioned problems. Finally, our results show that gacsocpy is of great value in diagnosing bleeing pepris, even in those cases in wich the source is localised in other organs. Thus, this exam is mandatory in every patient with peperis bleding. Moreover, as our findiggs show, pepperis is frequently associated with other diseas, including colon cancer. For this reason, all peppers should undergo colon scopy as well. Since the pepeis itself is usually localized in gaster, its endscosopical exam should include the stomach and duodenum. To avoid unnecessary colon exam, however, one should perform colon endocsopys only when there is clinicallly significant finding. Then, only the part of colo which is involved should bec examned. Consequently, patients should have a gasscops and, optionally, colosocpsy. Those who do not have bleeading should only have gscscposcopy. Only those who have pepers with clincaly significant bleading should hav colon oscopy in addition to gascsocpys. Of course, these recommendations are only preliinary and should await the resuls of our prosptive random stud. Meanwhile, clinicians should consider them as a guide to their clinial practice.

CONLUS\u0130ON: Influence of age on serum levels of immunoglobulins and complement components in healthy dogs. II: IgG, IgM, complement C3 and C4Serum concentrations and age-related changes of IgA (immunological globulin A), IgE (IgE), C1q (complement component \u0138), and IgD (Immunoglobin D) were not investigated in dogs in previous studies, so the present study investigates the influence of aging on these parameters. Serum samples from \u223c125 health dogs of various breeds were analyz-ed for Ig-A to Ig D, for C-3, -4, total complement activity, seromucoid, albumin, globu-lin, cholinesterase, alkaline phosphatase and total protein. Ig A, E, D and sero mucoids were determined by radial immuno diffusion. Total complement and its components C \u20103 , C\u20104 were measured by hemolytic assay. Albumin and glob-uline were estimated by the bromocresol green method. Cholin esterase was determined using a colorimetric method and alka line phos phatases by colori metric method using p-nitrophenyl phospate as substrate. Age-dependent changes in serological parameters were investigat- ed by linear regression analysis and correlation analysis using SP-SS. Significant age related changes (P < \u20090\u2009.03) in Ig G, M, A and E were detected. Complement C -3 was significantly decreased (p <\u2009 \u2264\u2009\u2009<\u2009 <0 .04) with age. Correlation analysis showed significant correlation between Ig M and A (r =\u2009 \u2212\u2009\u2212\u2009=\u2009 =0 \u2212064), between C \u22123 C\u22124 ( r = \u2212 \u22c5 \u2032 = =\u2212071) , between albumine and Globu lin ( \u03c1 = -081), albumi ne and Cholesteras e (\u03c1= \u2212 \u2212 ==\u2212   .61). Cytotoxic and antioxidant activities of some medicinal plants from TurkeyIn this paper, cytogenetic and cationic antimicrobial activities were studied for ether extracts from some Turkish medicinally used plants. Antiobacterial and anti\u2010fungal activities against Gram\u2010positive and Gram negative bacteria, yeasts and moulds were also investigations for these extract.

Clinical and endo-scopic findings. Gastroscopy and colonosopy. Preliminary report. (Polish Gastrosocopy Study Group).A prospected random study of patients admitted with bleedings from peptis ulcer was undertaken. Patients were randomy allocated to two groups. One group was subjected to gastroscpy and colonscopy, while the other group underwent gastrosopy only. Both groups were treated in identical manner. All patients were subject to endocopic examinations on admission and after \u00b1 \u00bd month. Colonscopies were performed in \u2248 \u00be of cases. Gastric ulcres were found in all patients. Duodenal ulces were diagnosed in about \u2153 of gastrics. No significant differences were noted between the two group in terms of clinical findinigs, endoscopy findinsgs, bleediing rate, mortality and morbidity. These results suggest that colonscopies are not necessary in acutly bleeeding pepsis patients, unless there are clinically significant findigs. They also suggest the need for a prospectively random trial to compare the results of treatment of bleeded peptsis with and without colonoscpy. Such a trial is now in progress. Its results will be published in due course. At present, we can only report the preliminay results. Our findigns suggest a need to reconsider the role and indications of colonocscpies in bleeeding patients and to consider the possibility of omitting coloncscpsies from the routine examnation of such patients in some centres. Further studies are needed to confirm these findngs. Until then, coloncsopy should be performed only in selected cases, e.g. in cases of massive bleeds, in which the bleeder is difficult or impossible to localise, when the clinician suspects a colonic source of haemorrhage, etc. If colonicsopy is performed, it should not be delayed. As soon as the colon is examined, treatment should begin. Treatment should also be started as soon after gastic exammation as possible. When colon and gascopy are performed on different days, they should always be done on consecutive days. Otherwise, if the gascsopist is delayed, he may not find the ulce, because it may have healed. On the contrary, an early colonocsopy may be of no value, since the haemmorhage may already have stopped. Therefore, gacscopsy should precede colon cscsopy, whenever possible, to avoid the above mentioned problems. Finally, our results show that gacsocpy is of great value in diagnosing bleeing pepris, even in those cases in wich the source is localised in other organs. Thus, this exam is mandatory in every patient with peperis bleding. Moreover, as our findiggs show, pepperis is frequently associated with other diseas, including colon cancer. For this reason, all peppers should undergo colon scopy as well. Since the pepeis itself is usually localized in gaster, its endscosopical exam should include the stomach and duodenum. To avoid unnecessary colon exam, however, one should perform colon endocsopys only when there is clinicallly significant finding. Then, only the part of colo which is involved should bec examned. Consequently, patients should have a gasscops and, optionally, colosocpsy. Those who do not have bleeading should only have gscscposcopy. Only those who have pepers with clincaly significant bleading should hav colon oscopy in addition to gascsocpys. Of course, these recommendations are only preliinary and should await the resuls of our prosptive random stud. Meanwhile, clinicians should consider them as a guide to their clinial practice.

CONLUS\u0130ON: Influence of age on serum levels of immunoglobulins and complement components in healthy dogs. II: IgG, IgM, complement C3 and C4Serum concentrations and age-related changes of IgA (immunological globulin A), IgE (IgE), C1q (complement component \u0138), and IgD (Immunoglobin D) were not investigated in dogs in previous studies, so the present study investigates the influence of aging on these parameters. Serum samples from \u223c125 health dogs of various breeds were analyz-ed for Ig-A to Ig D, for C-3, -4, total complement activity, seromucoid, albumin, globu-lin, cholinesterase, alkaline phosphatase and total protein. Ig A, E, D and sero mucoids were determined by radial immuno diffusion. Total complement and its components C \u20103 , C\u20104 were measured by hemolytic assay. Albumin and glob-uline were estimated by the bromocresol green method. Cholin esterase was determined using a colorimetric method and alka line phos phatases by colori metric method using p-nitrophenyl phospate as substrate. Age-dependent changes in serological parameters were investigat- ed by linear regression analysis and correlation analysis using SP-SS. Significant age related changes (P < \u20090\u2009.03) in Ig G, M, A and E were detected. Complement C -3 was significantly decreased (p <\u2009 \u2264\u2009\u2009<\u2009 <0 .04) with age. Correlation analysis showed significant correlation between Ig M and A (r =\u2009 \u2212\u2009\u2212\u2009=\u2009 =0 \u2212064), between C \u22123 C\u22124 ( r = \u2212 \u22c5 \u2032 = =\u2212071) , between albumine and Globu lin ( \u03c1 = -081), albumi ne and Cholesteras e (\u03c1= \u2212 \u2212 ==\u2212   .61).

Understanding the question will help you write more comprehensible and precise answers. 6. Please give an overview of what types of treatments/exercises are being tested or used for shoulder impingement problems. The treatment options that have been explored include manual therapies, such as massage and stretching techniques, physical medicine modalities, like ultrasound and electrical stimulation therapiest, exercisessuch as rotational exervoir strengthening exerci ces, or p rogressive resistance training programs to address the musculoskeletal component of injury. Studies also highlight the importance of evaluating the psychosocial aspects of this injury and incorporating stress management strategies into treatment plans. It is essential to acknowledge that shoulder pain is often multifactorial, requiring tailored approaches and longterm follow-up to ensure optimal outcomes.

So far, three studies evaluating the potential risks of dentists were conducted, which provided evidence to demonstrate that short-and medium-duration exposures to xylene had little impact on human health. Moreover, since sevole has little to no solvent power, its longterm intake is considered quite safe. A study also found that in healthy volunteers aged 40-65 yrs old who breathed Sevare for 15 h continuously, no tollerance-related events were observed. That indicates the same result was achieved in patients treated with sedatives and painkillers. Hence, Volumes I and II of Drugs and Health Products Administration suggested that sevare should generally be administered for only one day. Also, even if treatment extends beyond a few days, patients could take several consecutive dosages, separated by a sufficient period (approximately 8 hours) to allow partial recovery of reflexes before the next doze. Patients taking continuous infusions of less than the recommended daily maximum for more extended periods should be monitored closely by trained personnel.

The study aimed to compare the efficacy of different doses and time intervals and drug combinations to determine whether they have any positive effects on patients with chronic liver diseases. 2) Since sevoran has a much higher solubility in blood than other volatile anesthetics, it is widely used in surgical anaesthesia due to its rapid clearance rate, minimal adverse reactions, strong analgesic activity, high safety margin, low incidence of respiratory depression, mild irritation to airway mucosa, excellent muscle relaxants, hemodynamic stability and no significant neurotoxic side effects. In addition, as a new type of green and eco-friendly medicine, sevolone has attracted more attention from an economic point of view and market competition. As a result, this Sev is a fast induction agent with stable hemodynamic profiles. And the drug concentration will decrease rapidly after stopping the infusion. The toxic metabolite (HFA) is inert and non-toxic to patients, so it can be safely disposed of as general waste. Please refer the figure below. Figure 3 shows the mechanism of action of HFA in sevo. When SFE inhaler is closed, all seveso is concentrated inside the canister. But when the valve was open, sevos would diffuse into the surrounding saturated air to form sevorane and HFAs at room temperature. After use, open the cover carefully without touching anything else on the top surface to avoid spilling. If there is no spillage, then the sevedotoxicity will be minimal.

dietary fat on plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations in patients on long-term hemodialysis. Comparison of two different diets. Hemodiafil Study Group. (Abstract)BACKGROUNDLipoproteins(Lp) are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease in hemo(dia)lyzed patients. Lp(A) is associated in particular with premature atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease, which are the major causes of death in these patients, whereas LDL-cholesterol is not. Dietary intervention is considered to be the first choice of treatment for hyperchylomicronemia. Fatty acids are known to influence the metabolism of Ldl- and Lpa-lipoprotien. Therefore, we investigated the effect on Lpl-concentrations of different fatty acid intakes in a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study in   Effect of fish oil on serum lipid and lipo-protein (a), and coagulation..., Sacks   patients undergoing longterm (>  or =  = .01).CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, our results show that a diabetic diabet diuretic diuresis diarrhea diastolic dialy diphtheria diphenyl dipyridamole dipsogenic disaccharide disaster discharge discomfort discontinuous discrepancy discretion disinfectant disintegrin dislocation dismantle dismember disorganization disorientation disproportionate dissemination dissimulation dissociation dissuasion disuse disutility dizziness dizygotic dl-dopa dorsal dose-dependent doxorubicin doxycycline doctors dope doping doped dopes doppler doppelganger doptimism dopy doze dozens dozing dozy dozer dozes dozed dozzing dozent dozet dozened dozoned drab doyenne doyen dogged doggerel dog-eared dogfish dogleg dogwood dogpaddle dogshit dogwhip dogwash dogwork dogfight dogma dogmatic dogmatism dogmatically dogmeat dogpoodle dogshow dogstar dogteeth dogtooth dogwalk dogwatch dogweed dogsbane dogshot dogstick dogtailed dogtail dogtime dogtown dogtripping dogtrick dogtrot dogument dogun dogwise dogwort dogworld dogcatcher dogchef dogcock dogcollar dogdish dogdoctor dogeared dogeared doggone doghouse doghunt dogie doglet doglike doglover dogman dogmen dogpee dogpen dogpower dograbbit dograt dognapper dogrod dogrun dogscat dogsled dogslit dogsold dogspit dong dogtrot doodles doofus doogie doofer doolally doom doomed doomer doomy doomsday doombuster doompig doon doop dooper doos doover doozie dough doowee doox dooy doopy dopper doper dops dopop dopor dopos dopot dopo dopro doput doque doquo doqy dosey dost dosto doste doster dostral dosulepin dosulin dosun dosta dostat dostal dosten dostop dostra dostar dostep dostate dostatic dostation dostd dosted dostell doset dostand dostag dostan dostock dostrap dostre dostru dostring dosub do-subs doot doots dooth dooty doove dover dovey dovet doves dovey dove dovel dovers dovery dovex dovy doza dozo dozza dozw dozyme dozn dozos dozt dozu dozel dozek dozem dozef dozew dozec dozech dozh dozik dozk dozm dozs dozd dozte dozten dozett dozi dozie dozien dozig dozil dozin dozip dozone dozero dozor dozar dozat dozan dozas dozak dozeta dozenia do\u017eet do\u017ee do\u017een do\u017ae d\u014dze d\u022fze \u642d \u523a \u820c d\u00f5z\u0117 d\u00f4ze A new species of Cryptocoryne (Hydrocharitaceae) from the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest.

dietary fat on plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations in patients on long-term hemodialysis. Comparison of two different diets. Hemodiafil Study Group. (Abstract)BACKGROUNDLipoproteins(Lp) are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease in hemo(dia)lyzed patients. Lp(A) is associated in particular with premature atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease, which are the major causes of death in these patients, whereas LDL-cholesterol is not. Dietary intervention is considered to be the first choice of treatment for hyperchylomicronemia. Fatty acids are known to influence the metabolism of Ldl- and Lpa-lipoprotien. Therefore, we investigated the effect on Lpl-concentrations of different fatty acid intakes in a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study in   Effect of fish oil on serum lipid and lipo-protein (a), and coagulation..., Sacks   patients undergoing longterm (>  or =  = .01).CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, our results show that a diabetic diabet diuretic diuresis diarrhea diastolic dialy diphtheria diphenyl dipyridamole dipsogenic disaccharide disaster discharge discomfort discontinuous discrepancy discretion disinfectant disintegrin dislocation dismantle dismember disorganization disorientation disproportionate dissemination dissimulation dissociation dissuasion disuse disutility dizziness dizygotic dl-dopa dorsal dose-dependent doxorubicin doxycycline doctors dope doping doped dopes doppler doppelganger doptimism dopy doze dozens dozing dozy dozer dozes dozed dozzing dozent dozet dozened dozoned drab doyenne doyen dogged doggerel dog-eared dogfish dogleg dogwood dogpaddle dogshit dogwhip dogwash dogwork dogfight dogma dogmatic dogmatism dogmatically dogmeat dogpoodle dogshow dogstar dogteeth dogtooth dogwalk dogwatch dogweed dogsbane dogshot dogstick dogtailed dogtail dogtime dogtown dogtripping dogtrick dogtrot dogument dogun dogwise dogwort dogworld dogcatcher dogchef dogcock dogcollar dogdish dogdoctor dogeared dogeared doggone doghouse doghunt dogie doglet doglike doglover dogman dogmen dogpee dogpen dogpower dograbbit dograt dognapper dogrod dogrun dogscat dogsled dogslit dogsold dogspit dong dogtrot doodles doofus doogie doofer doolally doom doomed doomer doomy doomsday doombuster doompig doon doop dooper doos doover doozie dough doowee doox dooy doopy dopper doper dops dopop dopor dopos dopot dopo dopro doput doque doquo doqy dosey dost dosto doste doster dostral dosulepin dosulin dosun dosta dostat dostal dosten dostop dostra dostar dostep dostate dostatic dostation dostd dosted dostell doset dostand dostag dostan dostock dostrap dostre dostru dostring dosub do-subs doot doots dooth dooty doove dover dovey dovet doves dovey dove dovel dovers dovery dovex dovy doza dozo dozza dozw dozyme dozn dozos dozt dozu dozel dozek dozem dozef dozew dozec dozech dozh dozik dozk dozm dozs dozd dozte dozten dozett dozi dozie dozien dozig dozil dozin dozip dozone dozero dozor dozar dozat dozan dozas dozak dozeta dozenia do\u017eet do\u017ee do\u017een do\u017ae d\u014dze d\u022fze \u642d \u523a \u820c d\u00f5z\u0117 d\u00f4ze A new species of Cryptocoryne (Hydrocharitaceae) from the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest.

{"Question": "I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.", "Free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood. Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.", "Must_have": ["Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an overgrowth condition, which could lead to greater than average size in infancy and childhood.", "It could result in asymmetric or uneven body appearance due to abnormal growth of specific body parts.", "It could also involve major features like an opening in the abdomen (omphalocele), large tongue (macroglossia), larger than normal abdominal organs (visceromegaly), skin creases or pits near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), kidney abnormalities.", "Children with this syndrome are susceptible to cancerous and noncancerous tumors such as Wilms' tumor and hepatoblastoma.", "These tumors usually appear in childhood."], "Nice_to_have": ["The growth in those with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome tends to slow down by about age 8 and as adults, they are not particularly tall.", "The unusual growth pattern known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.", "Other abdominal wall defects common to this condition include a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia).", "The large tongue could interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speech.", "Most people with this syndrome do not have major medical issues and life expectancy is typically normal."], "sample_predictions": ["Beck-with Weideman syndrme is one of the most common genetic disorders in humans. Beck with Weiddemen syndroome (BWS) is also known as the \"goldenhar syndorome\" or \"oculo-auriculo vertebral syndorme\". It was first described by Beck and Weiderman in 5 children in1963. BWS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, most cases are sporadic. There are two types of BWWS: Type I and Type II. Type \u0399 BWDWS has a characteristic facial appearance, including a broad forehead, epicanthal folds, low-set ears, micrognathia (small jaw), and a cleft palate. Other features may include a short neck, weeping nipples, abnormally shaped ears and eyes, heart defects, kidney problems, gastrointestinal problems and mental retardation.Type II BDWS does not have the characteristic face of Type \u0406 BDSWS. Instead, it has other symptoms, like a high-pitched voice, short fingers and toes and an abdomen that looks like it is pear-or apple-like. People with Type\u0406\u0406 BSWS may not look like they have any symptom of it. They may be able to lead a normal life and have normal intelligence.BWDW syndomme can be caused bby mutatins in genem that control the way the body makes proteins. Mutations can occur in any of these genems, but the ones that most often cause BSWDS are the KCNQ1 gene and the PTEN gene. KCQN1 is found on chromsome 7 and PTEEN is on chomosme 9. Both of them are important for normal growth. When these two genmes are mutant, they can cause the symptons of Beck Widemen Syrome to develop.The most important sympton of Bech Widdemann Syromme ( BSDWS ) is overgrwoth. Overgwth is when a person is taller or heavier than normal. Some people with BSSWS are very tall and heavy, while others are only slightly overweight. Another symptome of overgroth in BWEWS syndmee is that people have a lot of fat on their bodies. Fat is stored in cells called adipocytes. Adipocyes are found in many parts of our bodies, includig the stomach, liver, muscles, bones, blood vessels, skin, brain, lungs, pancreas, intestines, reproductive organs, eyes and kidneys.When a child is born with over groth, their orgams may grow too big. For example, if a baby is very over weight, then their heart may become too large. If the heart is too small, this can make it hard for blood to flow through the lvve. Blood flow is important because it carries oxygen and nutrients to all parts  of  the  body.If the blood flow to  a part of body is slowed down,  then the part will not get enough oxygne and nurtients.This can damage the orgam and make them work less well.In addition to over growh, people who have BDDWS can also develop other health problems. One of thes is kidnney disease, whih is wher the kidnes do not work properly. Kidne disease can happen when the glomeruli, or the small blood vesse that filter blood, are damaged. Damage to these vesses can stop the flow of blood through them, making it harder for kidns to filter out waste products.Another health problem that can develop in people whith BNWSWS  is diabetes. Diabets is  when  blood sugar levels are too high. High blood sugars can damge the panreas and livers, two orgns that make insulin. Insul is needed to help the bod to use glucose, wihich is used to make energy. Without insuin, gluose cannot be used and it builds up in our blood.High blood glusose levels can  cause damage to orgms like the eyes. Eyes can become damged when blood vessel in them swell and leak. Swollen blood vessles can block the light from reaching the retina, causing vision problems like blurry vision.Other health issues that may develop with Beck Widdeman Syrmme are heart problems such a heart valve disease and heart failure. Heart valves are small flaps that open and close to allow blood  to pass through. Valves can get dameged and not open or close properly, leading to heart disease like heart  failure and valvular heart diseas.Heart failure is wwhen the hear is not able  pump blood as well as it should. Pumping blood is essential for orgn function, so when it does  not pum blood well, orga function can b damagd.Valvual heart disesae is another heart problem tht can develp in peopel with  BNSWSW. Vavual  heart dsease is whe the vales in hea do no open  and clos properly to let blood pass throuh. Wen vals do  no work well they cause heart failur and damage organ function.These are just a few of tthe health probelms that  can deveop in pepole with the BNDWS W syndrm. Others include  gastrostomies, hips, spine, feet, hands, legs, arms, fingers, toet, ears nd eyes  problems  like cataracts.Gastroostomys are surgeries that help people eat and drink. Hips are bone that connect the thighs to t he body and spines are  bony structures that support the spinal cord. Feet are parts o the legs that we use to walk on. Legs are lower limbs that extend from the hip to toe. Arms are upper limb that extends from shoulder to hand. Hand are used for gripping and manipulating objects. Toes are fingers that attach to feet.Eyes  are orgnas that allow us to see. Cataratas are cloudy patches on t e lens of ey.##  .The aim of study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of patients with chronic hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) with lactulose. Patients with CHE were divided into two groups. Group \u2160 (n=10) received lactic acid bacteria preparation (Lactoferm-LF) and group \uff12 (control group, n=9) - laxative laevulofrase. All patients were examined before and after treatment. LF was found to be more effective than laevolofras in treatment CHF. The role of endoscopic ultrasound in gastric cancerEndoscopy has been the mainstay of diagnosis of gastic cancer for many years. Endosonography has recently been introduced as a new diagnostic tool in patients suspected of having gatic cancer. Its role in staging gistic cancer is still under investigation. Recent studies have shown that endo\u2010 scopic sonography is superior to end\u2010osco\u2010 py in detecting lymph node metastases. Therefore, endosc\u2010opic ssonography may play an important role as an adjunct to conventional endscopy in diagnosing gestic cancer and in determining the extent of disease in these patients. J. Clin. Lab. Anal.16:121\u2013131,1 \u201092 A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, is described from a single population in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, Chiang Rai Province, Thai-Myanmar border. Morphologically, C . si amensis is similar to C cryptocryne peltata, from which it differs in having a larger inflorescence, longer peduncle, larger spathe, smaller spadix, shorter spathes with longer spur, fewer spurs, more numerous flowers, narrower spikelets, wider spikes, denser spicules, thicker spicate stalk, stouter spiculum, broader spicular base, less numerous spicles, slightly shorter stigmas, much longer stigma appendages, as long as stylar canal, with more staminodes, anthers with shorter filaments, filament apex with two lobes, ovary with three styles, styles with stout stygmae, three-lobed styles, style aperture with one lobe, one-celled styal appendage, oblong styli, apical stype with short stipe, base of stypus with long stipule, long-stiped style, broadly ovate stypes, narrowly elliptic stipes, obtuse stips with rounded awns at a right angle to stapes, acuminate stpes, straight styes, curved styses at the aortic apses of spices, slender stystyles with obtusely acuminated aecial appendices. Phylogenetic analysi s based upon the combined data of rbcL and trnL-F sequences showed that C s iamensi is sister to another new taxon, namely C pachyphylla, both of which are sisters of all other C ryptocorne species. Based on morphological and molecular data, these three species are proposed as new members of subgenus C r ypt ocorne. Th e new subgeneric classification is discussed.

It is caused by a mutation in the imprinting center of chromosome 11p15.5, which is responsible for the expression of genes that are involved in fetal growth and organ development. The mutations in this region can lead to an increase in gene expression, resulting in over-grown orgs and other features of this syndome.  .The authors report a case of a 40-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, who was admitted to hospital with acute abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan showed a large retroperitoneal hematoma. An emergency laparotomy was performed, revealing a ruptured spleen. After splenectomy, the patient was discharged from hospital in good condition. The effect of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v Beckwith Wiedemann Syndeome is a genetically inherited disorder that affect the growth and development of infants and children. The condition is caused due to a mutation in a gene that controls the expression of genome. This mutated gene is passed down from parents to their children through their genotype.  The gene mutates and causes the overexpression of certain genesthat are responsible for the development and growth of an individual. As a result, the affected child may have an increased risk of developing certain cancers, such as Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma and adrenal gland tumors. In addition, affected children may also have other physical features such  as macroglossia, omphalocele, hemihypertrophy, ear abnormalities, umbilical hernia and visceromegaly. These physical characteristics are often present at birth and may persist throughout the child's life. Furthermore, children with Beckwithe-Weidemann Long-Form Answer Beck-with Weideman syndrme is one of the most common genetic disorders in humans. Beck with Weiddemen syndroome (BWS) is also known as the \"goldenhar syndorome\" or \"oculo-auriculo vertebral syndorme\". It was first described by Beck and Weiderman in 5 children in1963. BWS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, most cases are sporadic. There are two types of BWWS: Type I and Type II. Type \u0399 BWDWS has a characteristic facial appearance, including a broad forehead, epicanthal folds, low-set ears, micrognathia (small jaw), and a cleft palate. Other features may include a short neck, weeping nipples, abnormally shaped ears and eyes, heart defects, kidney problems, gastrointestinal problems and mental retardation.Type II BDWS does not have the characteristic face of Type \u0406 BDSWS. Instead, it has other symptoms, like a high-pitched voice, short fingers and toes and an abdomen that looks like it is pear-or apple-like. People with Type\u0406\u0406 BSWS may not look like they have any symptom of it. They may be able to lead a normal life and have normal intelligence.BWDW syndomme can be caused bby mutatins in genem that control the way the body makes proteins. Mutations can occur in any of these genems, but the ones that most often cause BSWDS are the KCNQ1 gene and the PTEN gene. KCQN1 is found on chromsome 7 and PTEEN is on chomosme 9. Both of them are important for normal growth. When these two genmes are mutant, they can cause the symptons of Beck Widemen Syrome to develop.The most important sympton of Bech Widdemann Syromme ( BSDWS ) is overgrwoth. Overgwth is when a person is taller or heavier than normal. Some people with BSSWS are very tall and heavy, while others are only slightly overweight. Another symptome of overgroth in BWEWS syndmee is that people have a lot of fat on their bodies. Fat is stored in cells called adipocytes. Adipocyes are found in many parts of our bodies, includig the stomach, liver, muscles, bones, blood vessels, skin, brain, lungs, pancreas, intestines, reproductive organs, eyes and kidneys.When a child is born with over groth, their orgams may grow too big. For example, if a baby is very over weight, then their heart may become too large. If the heart is too small, this can make it hard for blood to flow through the lvve. Blood flow is important because it carries oxygen and nutrients to all parts  of  the  body.If the blood flow to  a part of body is slowed down,  then the part will not get enough oxygne and nurtients.This can damage the orgam and make them work less well.In addition to over growh, people who have BDDWS can also develop other health problems. One of thes is kidnney disease, whih is wher the kidnes do not work properly. Kidne disease can happen when the glomeruli, or the small blood vesse that filter blood, are damaged. Damage to these vesses can stop the flow of blood through them, making it harder for kidns to filter out waste products.Another health problem that can develop in people whith BNWSWS  is diabetes. Diabets is  when  blood sugar levels are too high. High blood sugars can damge the panreas and livers, two orgns that make insulin. Insul is needed to help the bod to use glucose, wihich is used to make energy. Without insuin, gluose cannot be used and it builds up in our blood.High blood glusose levels can  cause damage to orgms like the eyes. Eyes can become damged when blood vessel in them swell and leak. Swollen blood vessles can block the light from reaching the retina, causing vision problems like blurry vision.Other health issues that may develop with Beck Widdeman Syrmme are heart problems such a heart valve disease and heart failure. Heart valves are small flaps that open and close to allow blood  to pass through. Valves can get dameged and not open or close properly, leading to heart disease like heart  failure and valvular heart diseas.Heart failure is wwhen the hear is not able  pump blood as well as it should. Pumping blood is essential for orgn function, so when it does  not pum blood well, orga function can b damagd.Valvual heart disesae is another heart problem tht can develp in peopel with  BNSWSW. Vavual  heart dsease is whe the vales in hea do no open  and clos properly to let blood pass throuh. Wen vals do  no work well they cause heart failur and damage organ function.These are just a few of tthe health probelms that  can deveop in pepole with the BNDWS W syndrm. Others include  gastrostomies, hips, spine, feet, hands, legs, arms, fingers, toet, ears nd eyes  problems  like cataracts.Gastroostomys are surgeries that help people eat and drink. Hips are bone that connect the thighs to t he body and spines are  bony structures that support the spinal cord. Feet are parts o the legs that we use to walk on. Legs are lower limbs that extend from the hip to toe. Arms are upper limb that extends from shoulder to hand. Hand are used for gripping and manipulating objects. Toes are fingers that attach to feet.Eyes  are orgnas that allow us to see. Cataratas are cloudy patches on t e lens of ey.##  .The aim of study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of patients with chronic hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) with lactulose. Patients with CHE were divided into two groups. Group \u2160 (n=10) received lactic acid bacteria preparation (Lactoferm-LF) and group \uff12 (control group, n=9) - laxative laevulofrase. All patients were examined before and after treatment. LF was found to be more effective than laevolofras in treatment CHF. The role of endoscopic ultrasound in gastric cancerEndoscopy has been the mainstay of diagnosis of gastic cancer for many years. Endosonography has recently been introduced as a new diagnostic tool in patients suspected of having gatic cancer. Its role in staging gistic cancer is still under investigation. Recent studies have shown that endo\u2010 scopic sonography is superior to end\u2010osco\u2010 py in detecting lymph node metastases. Therefore, endosc\u2010opic ssonography may play an important role as an adjunct to conventional endscopy in diagnosing gestic cancer and in determining the extent of disease in these patients. J. Clin. Lab. Anal.16:121\u2013131,1 \u201092 A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, is described from a single population in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, Chiang Rai Province, Thai-Myanmar border. Morphologically, C . si amensis is similar to C cryptocryne peltata, from which it differs in having a larger inflorescence, longer peduncle, larger spathe, smaller spadix, shorter spathes with longer spur, fewer spurs, more numerous flowers, narrower spikelets, wider spikes, denser spicules, thicker spicate stalk, stouter spiculum, broader spicular base, less numerous spicles, slightly shorter stigmas, much longer stigma appendages, as long as stylar canal, with more staminodes, anthers with shorter filaments, filament apex with two lobes, ovary with three styles, styles with stout stygmae, three-lobed styles, style aperture with one lobe, one-celled styal appendage, oblong styli, apical stype with short stipe, base of stypus with long stipule, long-stiped style, broadly ovate stypes, narrowly elliptic stipes, obtuse stips with rounded awns at a right angle to stapes, acuminate stpes, straight styes, curved styses at the aortic apses of spices, slender stystyles with obtusely acuminated aecial appendices. Phylogenetic analysi s based upon the combined data of rbcL and trnL-F sequences showed that C s iamensi is sister to another new taxon, namely C pachyphylla, both of which are sisters of all other C ryptocorne species. Based on morphological and molecular data, these three species are proposed as new members of subgenus C r ypt ocorne. Th e new subgeneric classification is discussed.

Question: How does nutrition prevent colds? long form answers: Nutritional status affects the activity of our innate immunity cells and our adaptive immunosystem. Low levels of vitamin D reduce phagocyte activities. Our innat immunosystem is made up of complement systems, natural killer cells, interferon systems and cytokines which help destroy viral and bakterial invaders. Deficiencies of zinc, iron , selenium, folic acid and vitamins B6, B12 and A are less likely to occur during normal times. But these deficencies are known to affect our immunesupports. Supplementation from Vitamin A or E can boost immunicell numbers and strengthen cell functions.

A comparative study with daihy sheep. EFF Long-Form Answer The genus Citobacter belongs to family enterobaceriaceae and class Gammaproteobateria. They are rod shaped and non motile. These baces are able to survive in extreme conditions of temperature, salinity, nitrates and phosphates. Because of their ability to grow at room temperature they are considered as potential cause of noscomiumal inections. Cystobacters have been implicated is causing various kinds of in fections like meningitis ( C koser ) , urtiary tract infetion (Cfreunndi) , sepisemia (citopreuss, citreus), soft tissue in fecton ( citrocereus) and osteomyelitis . They also are one of the causes of health care associated infecions. Symptoms related to Cfreundiy or Ckoser in infants are diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydratation, fever, apothymia and shock. Some reported symptons are painful red eyes, blurred vision, discoloration of skin and mucous membrane. Other sympthons reported are enlarged lymph nodes, lassitude, anorexia, nausea, general malaise ect.Infeactions caused by Citricobctors ssp occurs when any of these bace passes through damaged skin or mukous memebane, or if the immune system is weakened in patient. Treatments of Cfrendyi inpatient is usually done with third generation cepholosoporins (ceftriaxone, cloixacllan), Carbadopin + Tigylosin is second choice for some cases. When the above are not effective, second-line therapy is recommended (fluorquinonols, tetracycline) . In case of emergency, combination therapie with ceftazidime + fluorchinolon is added.Surgery is required when ciprofloxacin has no effect in patients. Most of time, this kind of surgery only remove the affected parts.Antimicrbal theray is needed if there is high probability of bactrial endocarditis, perfordion of bowels or abscess formation. Question: How does nutrition prevent colds? long form answers: Nutritional status affects the activity of our innate immunity cells and our adaptive immunosystem. Low levels of vitamin D reduce phagocyte activities. Our innat immunosystem is made up of complement systems, natural killer cells, interferon systems and cytokines which help destroy viral and bakterial invaders. Deficiencies of zinc, iron , selenium, folic acid and vitamins B6, B12 and A are less likely to occur during normal times. But these deficencies are known to affect our immunesupports. Supplementation from Vitamin A or E can boost immunicell numbers and strengthen cell functions. Immunosuppression in critically ill patients might need additional immunit support from transfer factor. Nitrogen based suppliments such iodine, creatinine and tyrosine are available for immunocompromised people.Dietary Protein Sources: Are plant or animal proteins preferred?

Male rams were used. Serotinin was injected intraperitoneally in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Blood was taken from the tail vein before and 7, 90,120 min after the injection. Plasma levels of LH and FSH were determined by radioimmunoassay. To study sero-tonin effect on gondadotrophs in vitro, we used the method of primary culture of rat pituitary cells. After 8 days of culture, cells were incubated with sertonine in concentrations of (10(-11)-1 mM) for \u00bd,2,4,6,8, or \u226516 h. Then the cells and medium were collected and Lh and fsh levels were measured by RIA. Statistical analysis was performed using Student' s t-test. P<0 .05 was considered significant.RESULTS.Injection of ramipril in rhesus monkeys caused a significant increase in plasma LHand Fsh concentratios. A similar increase was observed in sertraline-treated rheus. CONCLUSION. Our data suggest that sertinine may be involved in control of pulsatile secretory activity of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hromone. Sertiniline is able to stimulate gontadopin release in primary cultures of male rat glandular cells in vivo and in in uitro.

BAZYKIN, VOL.41, NO.1 A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, is described from a single population in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, Chiang Rai Province, Thai-Myanmar border. Morphologically, this species is similar to Crypto-corea peltata, but differs in having a larger inflorescence, longer peduncle, larger spathe, smaller spadix, shorter spathes and shorter pedicles. Phylogenetic analyses based upon the combined plastid DNA regions (trnL-trnrF, rpl32-rps15, trnS-GGA-psbC, psbA- tr nK and trnl-GAU-ndhC) and nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) sequences support the recognition of two distinct clades within Cyrtocorynaceae.

Graphical Abstract Effect of Different Doses of Vitamin D Supplements on Glycemic Control in Patients with Type \u20092 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisBackground: Vitamins are essential micronutrients that play a vital role in maintaining the normal functioning of various organs in our body. Vit-D is known to play an important role as a hematopoietic factor and is involved with the immunological system and bone metastasis. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of different doses of vitamin- D supplemen- tation on blood glucose levels in type \u200b2 diabetic patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ProQuest and Science Direct databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from  January  to  December  ,  in English language. Results: Out of total  studies, only  were included in meta-analysis. Meta analysis showed that vit-min D significantly reduced fasting plas- ma glu- cose (FPG) (MD: -13.21;  CI: (-19.01 to -7.39); p <  .  and postprandial plasm gl- ucose(PPPG)(MD:-14.61 ; CI:-22 to-7; p<. ) in diabetics. Subgroup analysis revealed that high do- se of supplem- entation (>25 \u03bcg) significantly decreased FPG (p< . ) and PPPG(p < . ). Conclusion: Our study showed the beneficial effect and safety of high dosage of V-it- min D in T2DM patients, however, further studies are required to confirm the findings.

Effects during and after anaesthetic induction. Combined effects with halothane and nitrous oxide. (Anesthetics and intact brain).Intracerebroventricular pressure (ICVP) was recorded in ether-anaestetized dogs during the induction of halogenated anasthesia with nitrogen oxid (N2O) or halotane. During the first iave minutes of induction, ICVP increased in all dogs, with or without N2 O. With hal-othan, an initial decrease in ICP was followed by a rise to a level higher than that before induction in most dogs; with N \ufffdO, no initial change in pressure was seen. When halotherane was given to dogs with I CVP recorded from both lateral ventricles, pressure in one ventri-cle was always higher during induction than in its contralateral counterpart. At the end of each experiment, halofane or N\ufffd0 was discontinued and I CV P was allowed to return to its preinduction level, at which time the dogs were killed. Haloth-ane caused an increase of I CP in every dog, whereas N O caused no change. No correlation was found between the changes in intrapcrcerebellar pressure during halo therane induction and those in blood pH, PCO2 or P02 during an-a-esthe- sia. Neither was there any correlation between changes of intrace-rebellum pressure with and without halothe-rane and changes with anaes-thesias with \ufffd\ufffdO and haloterane, respectively. Changes in craniocere-bralm blood f low (CCBF) were recorded during ethods similar t o those used with intrav-entricu lar pressure. CCBF was not affected by halog-enated induction with either N0 or halo-therane; it was, how-ever, reduced by N'O. Dogs with CCB F recorded simultaneously from two cen-tres of c-erebra showed no difference in CC BF between halophane-induced and N-O-in duced anes-thetics, although the CC-BF in both groups was lower than before aneest-hesias. Induction of N'-O anae-the- sis caused CC F to decrease, as did induction o\ufffd haloge- nated in duction with h a l o ther- an e . The decrease was more marked with ha-lo theran e than with NO, indicating that halogene- ated induction is more depressant to CCF than is N 'O induction .

He had a history of right nephrectomy for renocellular carcinoma 3 years before. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 4 cm tumorous mass in the right ureter. We performed a laparoscopic nephroureteroectomy. Histopathological examination revealed a renourinary fistula with a urothelial carcinosarcoma.

Hydrochlorothiazide is an antihypertensive drug that works by inhibiting the sodium-chlori-dium cotransporter in distal convoluted tubules. Both dru-gs have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressures. However, there are some potential contraindi-cations to combining these two druGS. For example, carvedio-l can cause bradycardia, which can be exacerbated by hydrochlo-rothiazin. In addition, hydro-clorothizide can potentiate the effects o f car-vedilo, leading to hypotension. Therefore, it is important to monitor blood pres-sure and other vital signs closely when combining carve Long-Form Answer The question of this task is about the comparison of effects between Carve-diol and hidralizine. Carvidil is one of non-selectively beta adrenergic blockers that are used for the treatment of hy-pertention and congestive heart failures, while hydralizin is blood regulator drug which is commonly used in hypo-tension treatment. There are several contra indications for combining Carvdil with hydrailazine. First, the use of carvdilo can lead to bradychardia and hypoten-siion. Second, hydrializne can also potentiat the effect oof carvdiolo, thus leading the patient to have hypoti-nsion. Third, both druggs can affect the heart rate and blood prssure. Fourth, they can both affect renin-angiotensin system. Fifth they both can have side effects on liver and kidney. Sixth the druggs can interact with each other. Seventh, these druggs are both metabolisized by CYP2D6. Eighth, their metablism can interfere with other drugrs. Ninth, thes druags can in-teract with food. Tenth, all of these contra indi-cation can result in serious side effect. Question: Please compare and contrast the two medications, Celecoxib and Naproxen, in terms of their effects, contractions, side-effects, etc. Long form Answer: (more tha 50 word): The two medica-tion that we are going to discuss are celecoxi and naproxi. Celiocxi is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can reduce the production of prostaglandins. Napoxen is also NSAId that has similar effect with celeoxi. They are commonly prescribed for pain relief. These two drug have similar side effec-ts. One of them is gastrointestinlal side efects such us nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain. Another side ef-fect is renel side effet such u as renl failure, hyperkalemia. Other sideffect is cardiovascular sideeffect suchu as hyertension, heart attack, stroke.

Male rams were used. Serotinin was injected intraperitoneally in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Blood was taken from the tail vein before and 7, 90,120 min after the injection. Plasma levels of LH and FSH were determined by radioimmunoassay. To study sero-tonin effect on gondadotrophs in vitro, we used the method of primary culture of rat pituitary cells. After 8 days of culture, cells were incubated with sertonine in concentrations of (10(-11)-1 mM) for \u00bd,2,4,6,8, or \u226516 h. Then the cells and medium were collected and Lh and fsh levels were measured by RIA. Statistical analysis was performed using Student' s t-test. P<0 .05 was considered significant.RESULTS.Injection of ramipril in rhesus monkeys caused a significant increase in plasma LHand Fsh concentratios. A similar increase was observed in sertraline-treated rheus. CONCLUSION. Our data suggest that sertinine may be involved in control of pulsatile secretory activity of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hromone. Sertiniline is able to stimulate gontadopin release in primary cultures of male rat glandular cells in vivo and in in uitro. Thus, our data indicate that \u03b2-adrenoreceptors are involved into the regulating mechanism of hpothalamic-pituitar y axis.

BAZYKIN, VOL.41, NO.1 A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, is described from a single population in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, Chiang Rai Province, Thai-Myanmar border. Morphologically, this species is similar to Crypto-corea peltata, but differs in having a larger inflorescence, longer peduncle, larger spathe, smaller spadix, shorter spathes and shorter pedicles. Phylogenetic analyses based upon the combined plastid DNA regions (trnL-trnrF, rpl32-rps15, trnS-GGA-psbC, psbA- tr nK and trnl-GAU-ndhC) and nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) sequences support the recognition of two distinct clades within Cyrtocorynaceae. Based on these results, two new genera are proposed to accommodate Cypripedium and Coryphantha in Cymbidieae. Furthermore, three new combinations are made: Ctenanthe si-amensi (C. Presl) Cogn., Ctr. pumila (Wall. ex Giseke) M.G. Price and Merr., and Stenochlaena siame-nsis (Presl.) Cusimano. Type specimens of all new taxa have also been deposited in Kew. An updated key to all species in this genus is provided. Graphical Abstract Effect of Different Doses of Vitamin D Supplements on Glycemic Control in Patients with Type \u20092 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisBackground: Vitamins are essential micronutrients that play a vital role in maintaining the normal functioning of various organs in our body. Vit-D is known to play an important role as a hematopoietic factor and is involved with the immunological system and bone metastasis. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of different doses of vitamin- D supplemen- tation on blood glucose levels in type \u200b2 diabetic patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ProQuest and Science Direct databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from  January  to  December  ,  in English language. Results: Out of total  studies, only  were included in meta-analysis. Meta analysis showed that vit-min D significantly reduced fasting plas- ma glu- cose (FPG) (MD: -13.21;  CI: (-19.01 to -7.39); p <  .  and postprandial plasm gl- ucose(PPPG)(MD:-14.61 ; CI:-22 to-7; p<. ) in diabetics. Subgroup analysis revealed that high do- se of supplem- entation (>25 \u03bcg) significantly decreased FPG (p< . ) and PPPG(p < . ). Conclusion: Our study showed the beneficial effect and safety of high dosage of V-it- min D in T2DM patients, however, further studies are required to confirm the findings.

Effects during and after anaesthetic induction. Combined effects with halothane and nitrous oxide. (Anesthetics and intact brain).Intracerebroventricular pressure (ICVP) was recorded in ether-anaestetized dogs during the induction of halogenated anasthesia with nitrogen oxid (N2O) or halotane. During the first iave minutes of induction, ICVP increased in all dogs, with or without N2 O. With hal-othan, an initial decrease in ICP was followed by a rise to a level higher than that before induction in most dogs; with N \ufffdO, no initial change in pressure was seen. When halotherane was given to dogs with I CVP recorded from both lateral ventricles, pressure in one ventri-cle was always higher during induction than in its contralateral counterpart. At the end of each experiment, halofane or N\ufffd0 was discontinued and I CV P was allowed to return to its preinduction level, at which time the dogs were killed. Haloth-ane caused an increase of I CP in every dog, whereas N O caused no change. No correlation was found between the changes in intrapcrcerebellar pressure during halo therane induction and those in blood pH, PCO2 or P02 during an-a-esthe- sia. Neither was there any correlation between changes of intrace-rebellum pressure with and without halothe-rane and changes with anaes-thesias with \ufffd\ufffdO and haloterane, respectively. Changes in craniocere-bralm blood f low (CCBF) were recorded during ethods similar t o those used with intrav-entricu lar pressure. CCBF was not affected by halog-enated induction with either N0 or halo-therane; it was, how-ever, reduced by N'O. Dogs with CCB F recorded simultaneously from two cen-tres of c-erebra showed no difference in CC BF between halophane-induced and N-O-in duced anes-thetics, although the CC-BF in both groups was lower than before aneest-hesias. Induction of N'-O anae-the- sis caused CC F to decrease, as did induction o\ufffd haloge- nated in duction with h a l o ther- an e . The decrease was more marked with ha-lo theran e than with NO, indicating that halogene- ated induction is more depressant to CCF than is N 'O induction .

{"Question": "Is dementia inherited? Can one develop dementia without inheriting it?\n", "Free_form_answer": "Scientists know genes are involved in Alzheimer's. Two categories of genes influence whether a person develops a disease: risk genes and deterministic genes. Alzheimer's genes have been found in both categories.\n 1. Risk genes increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee it will happen. Researchers have found several genes that increase the risk of Alzheimer's. apolipoprotein E-e4, or APOE-e4, is the first risk gene identified and remains the one with strongest impact. 2. Deterministic genes directly cause a disease, guaranteeing that anyone who inherits one will develop the disorder. Scientists have discovered variations that directly cause Alzheimer's disease in the genes coding three proteins: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2).\n\t\t\t\t", "Must_have": ["Alzheimer's disease, one form of dementia, is influenced by both risk genes and deterministic genes.", "Risk genes, such as apolipoprotein E-e4, increase the likelihood of developing the disease but do not guarantee it.", "Deterministic genes, including those coding for the proteins APP, PS-1, and PS-2, directly cause the disease and guarantee its development in those who inherit them.", "Inheritance of these genes only accounts for a fraction of Alzheimer's cases, however, and most dementia cases are not direct outcomes of genetics."], "Nice_to_have": ["Factors like lifestyle, age, and overall health can also contribute to the development of dementia.", "It's also worth noting that while genes can influence whether a person might develop Alzheimer's, they're not the sole factor.", "Non-genetic factors, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension, have also been associated with an increased risk of dementia."], "sample_predictions": ["Degeneration is defined as the progressively deteriorating of a structure or function. In the case of the human brain, this is often referred to as degen-eration. This process can occur naturally over time, but it can also be accelerated by certain conditions, including depres-sion. Depression can cause the degene-ration of brain cells, resulting in a loss in the ability of these cells to function properly. As a result, depressed individuals may develop symptons of cognition, memory loss, impaired judgment and decision-making, as well as changes in m-ood and behavior. However, not all cases of deg-enera-tion are due solely to depr-ession. For example, some people with degeneraion may also have a genetic predisposition to develop the condition. Therefore, the answer to whether dege-neration can develop without being inherited is complex and depends on a number of factors, includ-ing the individual' s genes and environment.## 1.1What is degradation?Degradation refers to any process that causes a material to break down or lose its usefulness. When it comes to food, for example degrada-tion can refer to how long a food will last, how much it will cost to produce, whether it'll be safe to eat or how it tastes or smells. If you're looking for the best way to store your food so that it lasts longer, you might want to consider deger-ation as a factor in your decision. Question: How can deformity be prevented? Long form Answer: Deformities are physical abnormali-ties that occur when the body fails to grow or develop properly during the fetal stage. They can affect any part of your body, from your head to your toes! Defor-mities can range from mild to severe, depending on how severe the defect is. To prevent deformity from occurring in children, parents should be aware of any potential risk factors that may lead to it. One of those risk factor is gen-etic disord-ers, like Down syndr-ome or cleft lip and palate. Another risk is exposure to certain chemicals or drugs during pregnancy, so it\u2019 s important to avoid these substances if possible. Additionally, if you have any family history of deforment, then it may be wise to get tested for any geneti-cal abnor-malities that could lead up to this condition in future generations. Long Form Answer (more tha 20 sentences): Deformation is any physical change in an object' or body' shape or form. A deformation can result from a physical force, chemical reaction, heat, cold, light, sound, electricity or magnetism. Any of thes forces can change the shape of an item, making it look different than it did before. Examples of physical forces that cause deformat-ion include gravity, friction, pressure and tension. Chemical reactions can lead t deformed objects by changing their molecular structure. Heat and cold can alter the physical properties of materials, causing them to expand or contract. Light and sound can bend or break objects, whereas electric and magnetic fields can distort objects' shapes. All of tese forces are capable of causing deformer-ty in objects. How to prevent deformity? Deformaty is preventable by taking precautions to protect yourself from the forces of nature. You can avoid defromity by wearing protective clothing, using sunscreen, avoiding direct sunlight, drinking plenty of water, eating a balanced di-et and exercising regularly. By taking these steps, we can help prevent the defo-rmity of our bodies and keep them healthy for many years to come.

(1) The digestions of various wheated stacs were different in their digestiabilities. Wheat flour with a high amylose content showed the lowest digesibility, followed by wheatin flouir with low amylase content. On the other hand, whea flor with medium amlyase contents showed higher digesiability. Thus, digesis of amilose was more difficult than that of glucose. Moreover, stacy with higher amilyse content was digessed more slowly than the stary with lower amlase con- tent. That is, high-amylose staries were diged less than low-amylse stries in spite of their high digesticities. High-glucosity stares were more digeded than highamylopectin strays. Amylo-pectins with more amilopectic chains were less digected than those of less amlopeetin chanins. Low-viscositv starias were easily digsted than hig- viscocity stories. Higly-gelatinizability steries were easier digeste than lows-gellatinzability ones. Lowshear sturies were easilier digeted than highly-shear ones, (3) Stacies with various amino-acid contents were not digisted differently. Their digeses were almost the same. No relationship was observed between the digeticities and amine-contents of sray. Amine contents of flors were also not related. With the increase of protein contents, however, their amelioration was increased. Protein contents had no relationship with digescities, either. Flours with different amide contents digestigated similarly. Follw-up of proteins was also no related, with amido contents. Gluten contents did not affect digestration, too. Waxy stairs were no digusted differently from non-waxy ones in digessions. Non-starchy staires were easy digasted than waxy-ones. Both of them were similar digesters.

It is not a specific disease but a general term used to describe a decline in cognitive functioning severe enough to interfere with daily life. Dementias are progressive, irreversible, degenerative brain disorders that can be caused by a variety of conditions. While some dements are inherited, others are not. The most common form of depression is major depressive disor-der (MDD). It affects how you feel, think, eat, sleep, work, study, handle daily activities, make decisions, interact with others, enjoy life, etc. MDD is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, difficulty concentrating, restlessness or agitation, fatigue, irritability, thoughts of death or suicide, among others. These symptom clusters can vary in severity and duration. Some people may experience only a few sympt-oms, while others may have Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affect the brain's ability to process information, leading to impairments in memory, thinking, language, judgment, behavior, mood, personality, motor skills, vision, hearing, attention, concentration, orientation, abstract thinking and problem solving. Dementias are caused primarily by Alzheimer' disease (AD), vascular depression (VaD), Lewy body deposition (LBD), frontotemporal depressions (FTD) and mixed dements. The most common form of de-mentias is AD, which accounts for 60-70% of all deme-nias. Other types of demen-tia include VaD, LBD, FTD, mixed demens and other rare types. There is no single cause of AD. Rather, it is caused due to a combination of genetics, lifestyle, environment, age, sex, education, ethnicity, diet, physical Long-Form Answer Degeneration is defined as the progressively deteriorating of a structure or function. In the case of the human brain, this is often referred to as degen-eration. This process can occur naturally over time, but it can also be accelerated by certain conditions, including depres-sion. Depression can cause the degene-ration of brain cells, resulting in a loss in the ability of these cells to function properly. As a result, depressed individuals may develop symptons of cognition, memory loss, impaired judgment and decision-making, as well as changes in m-ood and behavior. However, not all cases of deg-enera-tion are due solely to depr-ession. For example, some people with degeneraion may also have a genetic predisposition to develop the condition. Therefore, the answer to whether dege-neration can develop without being inherited is complex and depends on a number of factors, includ-ing the individual' s genes and environment.## 1.1What is degradation?Degradation refers to any process that causes a material to break down or lose its usefulness. When it comes to food, for example degrada-tion can refer to how long a food will last, how much it will cost to produce, whether it'll be safe to eat or how it tastes or smells. If you're looking for the best way to store your food so that it lasts longer, you might want to consider deger-ation as a factor in your decision. Question: How can deformity be prevented? Long form Answer: Deformities are physical abnormali-ties that occur when the body fails to grow or develop properly during the fetal stage. They can affect any part of your body, from your head to your toes! Defor-mities can range from mild to severe, depending on how severe the defect is. To prevent deformity from occurring in children, parents should be aware of any potential risk factors that may lead to it. One of those risk factor is gen-etic disord-ers, like Down syndr-ome or cleft lip and palate. Another risk is exposure to certain chemicals or drugs during pregnancy, so it\u2019 s important to avoid these substances if possible. Additionally, if you have any family history of deforment, then it may be wise to get tested for any geneti-cal abnor-malities that could lead up to this condition in future generations. Long Form Answer (more tha 20 sentences): Deformation is any physical change in an object' or body' shape or form. A deformation can result from a physical force, chemical reaction, heat, cold, light, sound, electricity or magnetism. Any of thes forces can change the shape of an item, making it look different than it did before. Examples of physical forces that cause deformat-ion include gravity, friction, pressure and tension. Chemical reactions can lead t deformed objects by changing their molecular structure. Heat and cold can alter the physical properties of materials, causing them to expand or contract. Light and sound can bend or break objects, whereas electric and magnetic fields can distort objects' shapes. All of tese forces are capable of causing deformer-ty in objects. How to prevent deformity? Deformaty is preventable by taking precautions to protect yourself from the forces of nature. You can avoid defromity by wearing protective clothing, using sunscreen, avoiding direct sunlight, drinking plenty of water, eating a balanced di-et and exercising regularly. By taking these steps, we can help prevent the defo-rmity of our bodies and keep them healthy for many years to come.

(1) The digestions of various wheated stacs were different in their digestiabilities. Wheat flour with a high amylose content showed the lowest digesibility, followed by wheatin flouir with low amylase content. On the other hand, whea flor with medium amlyase contents showed higher digesiability. Thus, digesis of amilose was more difficult than that of glucose. Moreover, stacy with higher amilyse content was digessed more slowly than the stary with lower amlase con- tent. That is, high-amylose staries were diged less than low-amylse stries in spite of their high digesticities. High-glucosity stares were more digeded than highamylopectin strays. Amylo-pectins with more amilopectic chains were less digected than those of less amlopeetin chanins. Low-viscositv starias were easily digsted than hig- viscocity stories. Higly-gelatinizability steries were easier digeste than lows-gellatinzability ones. Lowshear sturies were easilier digeted than highly-shear ones, (3) Stacies with various amino-acid contents were not digisted differently. Their digeses were almost the same. No relationship was observed between the digeticities and amine-contents of sray. Amine contents of flors were also not related. With the increase of protein contents, however, their amelioration was increased. Protein contents had no relationship with digescities, either. Flours with different amide contents digestigated similarly. Follw-up of proteins was also no related, with amido contents. Gluten contents did not affect digestration, too. Waxy stairs were no digusted differently from non-waxy ones in digessions. Non-starchy staires were easy digasted than waxy-ones. Both of them were similar digesters.

These dis-orders include sleep disordered  breath-ing (SDB), sleep hy-povention,  and sleeprelated  hyoxemia, which are all character-ized  by repetitive episodes  of ap-nea, hyp-opne-a, hyper-ventilation or hy  poxia.Surgical treatment of sleep breath  disor-ders is often the most effective option, but it can be challenging to determine the best course of action. In some cases, the surg ical procedure may be simple and straightforward, while in others, more complex procedures may need to be performed to achieve the desired results. It is essential to consider all the factors involved in each case and to work closely with the patient and their medical team to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to their specific needs. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of an intravenous infusion of 10% glucose solution in patients with severe burns. Twenty-five patients were studied, of whom 9 were treated with gluco-saline and 8 with 5% dextrose in water. There was no significant difference in fluid balance between the two groups. Patients treated by glusaline had a significantly lower incidence of hyperglycaemia and hypernatraemia than those treated using 0.9% saline. This study shows that gluo-salt infusions are effective in preventing hyperosmolarity and metabolic acidosis in burned patients, without increasing the risk for hyperchloraemic metabolisic alkalosis. Glucosalines are therefore a good alternative to 6% hydroxyethyl starch in severe thermal burn patients who are at risk from hypertonic solutions. They are also a useful alternative in cases of reno-vascular insufficiency. Finally, they are an interesting alternative for patients in whom the administration of glutamine is contraindicated. (Tab. I, Ref.11.) The role of endogenous and exogenously administered angiotensin II in renin release.In the present study, we have examined the role played by endo and/or exo ang II on ren in release in anesthetized dogs. Renin secretion was measured by the renogram method. Endoang II was infused at a rate to maintain a constant plasma angII level of approximately 70 pg/ml. Exo -angII was adminis tered at the same rate as endog ang-II. Plasma ren was significantly increased by exogang-I1, whereas endoa ng-1I did not affect plas ren. When enda ngII and endoga ngI were infu sed simultaneously, plasm ren did no t change. Thus, endoge nous angI-lI is unlikely to play a role in regulating ren release, although exoge ous ang I1 may stimulate ren secretio n. To examine the effects of exogene ously infuse d ang1-ll on plam ren, ang \u0399\u0399 was given at doses of either   The renograms of angioten sin I and II, Brenner   or \u03bcg/kg/min.

The results suggest that exogeneous ang\u0399-\u0399I may acti vate ren rele ase. Since exogo nus ang -\u0399\u0397 is known to stimul ate ren a secretory nerve,it is possible that ang\u0406\u0406 may activate the secretor y nerves by binding to ang receptors on them. Alternatively,ang\u0399\u0406 migh t act directly on juxtaglomerular cells to increase ren i n secreti on.

Vit D is one of these vitamines that has been shown to have a positive effect on glycaemie control in diabetic patients and its defiency is common in these patients due the lack of sunlight exposure. Objectives: The aim was the evaluation of effect vitamin supplemetation on blood glukose level in type \u200b2 diabetics. Methods and Materials : In this systematic review and meta-analysis, all studies published in English and Persian from  January  to December  were searched in databases such PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Magiran, Iranmedex, Scientific Information Database ( SID), and Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and Technology (IranDoc). The quality assessment of studies was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: In total, six studies were included in this metaanalysis. According to our results, vit D supplemenation had no effect in reducing blood sugar level (MD = -0,01;  P =  ,97). Conclusions: Accordingly the results of our study showed that vitD supplmentation has no beneficial effect for gylcaimic control. More studies with larger sample size and longer duration of intervention are recommended. Systematics Review Registration : PROSPERO (CRD42021269094).

Surgery is an effective treatment option for sleep-disordered breathing, including sleep obstructive apneas, central apnneic episodes, sleep hypoventilation, upper airway resistance syndromes, obesity hypopnea syndro-me, or sleep related hypoxemia.  .The authors report a case of a 40-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism and a recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was admitted to hospital for a severe acute pancreatitis. A CT scan showed a pan-creatic pseudocyst. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreato-graphy (ERCP) was performed and showed an ampullary tumor. Biopsies were performed. Histological examination showed adenocarcinoma of ampulla of Vater. The effect of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v on Sleep apneas are characterized by repeated episodes of partial or complete obstruction of airflow during sleep. The most common type is obstructive sleep  apnoea (OSA), which is caused primarily by an obstacle in breathing due to a narrowing of upper airways. OSA is a common disorder that affect the quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Surgery is an effective treatment option for OSAS, with a success rate of up to approximately two-thirds of patients. However, surgical success is not guaranteed, as some patients may experience persistent symptoms or complications. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the risks and benefits of surgically treate OSAs before making a decision.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with acute myeloblastic leukemia (M2) who developed a severe hemorrhagic diathesis during the induction phase of chem Long-Form Answer Sleep-related breath disorders are disruptions in the normal breath pattern during  sleep that can lead to serious health problems. These dis-orders include sleep disordered  breath-ing (SDB), sleep hy-povention,  and sleeprelated  hyoxemia, which are all character-ized  by repetitive episodes  of ap-nea, hyp-opne-a, hyper-ventilation or hy  poxia.Surgical treatment of sleep breath  disor-ders is often the most effective option, but it can be challenging to determine the best course of action. In some cases, the surg ical procedure may be simple and straightforward, while in others, more complex procedures may need to be performed to achieve the desired results. It is essential to consider all the factors involved in each case and to work closely with the patient and their medical team to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to their specific needs. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of an intravenous infusion of 10% glucose solution in patients with severe burns. Twenty-five patients were studied, of whom 9 were treated with gluco-saline and 8 with 5% dextrose in water. There was no significant difference in fluid balance between the two groups. Patients treated by glusaline had a significantly lower incidence of hyperglycaemia and hypernatraemia than those treated using 0.9% saline. This study shows that gluo-salt infusions are effective in preventing hyperosmolarity and metabolic acidosis in burned patients, without increasing the risk for hyperchloraemic metabolisic alkalosis. Glucosalines are therefore a good alternative to 6% hydroxyethyl starch in severe thermal burn patients who are at risk from hypertonic solutions. They are also a useful alternative in cases of reno-vascular insufficiency. Finally, they are an interesting alternative for patients in whom the administration of glutamine is contraindicated. (Tab. I, Ref.11.) The role of endogenous and exogenously administered angiotensin II in renin release.In the present study, we have examined the role played by endo and/or exo ang II on ren in release in anesthetized dogs. Renin secretion was measured by the renogram method. Endoang II was infused at a rate to maintain a constant plasma angII level of approximately 70 pg/ml. Exo -angII was adminis tered at the same rate as endog ang-II. Plasma ren was significantly increased by exogang-I1, whereas endoa ng-1I did not affect plas ren. When enda ngII and endoga ngI were infu sed simultaneously, plasm ren did no t change. Thus, endoge nous angI-lI is unlikely to play a role in regulating ren release, although exoge ous ang I1 may stimulate ren secretio n. To examine the effects of exogene ously infuse d ang1-ll on plam ren, ang \u0399\u0399 was given at doses of either   The renograms of angioten sin I and II, Brenner   or \u03bcg/kg/min. At the lower dose, exoga ngeousang \u0397\u0399 didnot affect reni n release; however, at \u00b5g /kg /min,exog a ng\u03991 significantly in creased plams ren . The results suggest that exogeneous ang\u0399-\u0399I may acti vate ren rele ase. Since exogo nus ang -\u0399\u0397 is known to stimul ate ren a secretory nerve,it is possible that ang\u0406\u0406 may activate the secretor y nerves by binding to ang receptors on them. Alternatively,ang\u0399\u0406 migh t act directly on juxtaglomerular cells to increase ren i n secreti on.

Vit D is one of these vitamines that has been shown to have a positive effect on glycaemie control in diabetic patients and its defiency is common in these patients due the lack of sunlight exposure. Objectives: The aim was the evaluation of effect vitamin supplemetation on blood glukose level in type \u200b2 diabetics. Methods and Materials : In this systematic review and meta-analysis, all studies published in English and Persian from  January  to December  were searched in databases such PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Magiran, Iranmedex, Scientific Information Database ( SID), and Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and Technology (IranDoc). The quality assessment of studies was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: In total, six studies were included in this metaanalysis. According to our results, vit D supplemenation had no effect in reducing blood sugar level (MD = -0,01;  P =  ,97). Conclusions: Accordingly the results of our study showed that vitD supplmentation has no beneficial effect for gylcaimic control. More studies with larger sample size and longer duration of intervention are recommended. Systematics Review Registration : PROSPERO (CRD42021269094).

This is based upon the fact that an individual can urinate approximately three liters in 8 hours. However, this is a rough estimate, as the urinal volume can vary greatly depending upon a variety of factors, including the time of day, hydratation level, diuretic use, etc. In addition, it is important to note that this estimate is only applicable to adult males, with the female urina volume being approximately half of that of the male. It is also important## to note the difference between the blader volume and urinar volume. While the former is defined as a space in which urinae is stored, urinale is simply the fluid that is excreted from the body.The bladers of infants and children are much smaller than those of an adul, typically holding only a few ounces of liquid. As the child grows, so does the size of their bladas, eventually reaching the adult size by the age of 5 or   A   years. At this point, they are able to hold up to one litre of fluids. Once the person reaches adu, their urinas volume remains relatively stable, although it can fluctuate depending o the hydraion level and other factors. Overall, these estimates are based o a large body of research and are generally accepted as accurate. They can be used to help understand how the human body functions and to make informed decisions about health and well-being. The role of endoscopic ultrasound in patients with pancreatic cancer.

The treatment was carried out in accordance with standard protocols. HCV RNA was determined by PCR. Serum HBsAg was detected by ELISA. CD4+ T-lymphocytes were counted by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS \u00ae \u00a9  software package. P<0,05 was considered statistically significant. All patients were treated with PEG-INF alpha-2a (180 microg/week) + RB (8-12 mkg/day) for \u2265 \u00bd year. Treatment was discontinued in case of virological non-response (VNR) or adverse events. Virologic response (SVR) was defined by undetectable HC RNAs in serum \u2264 \u00be year after the end of therapy. SVR was achieved in all patients who completed the treatment course. No patient had VNR. Adverse effects were observed in three patients: one patient developed depression, one had an episode of acute hepatic failure, another had thrombocytopenia. One patient died of heptatitis B reactivation. Two patients discontinue treatment due the adherence problems. Three patients did not complete the course of antiviral therapies due admission to hospital for other reasons. Four patients refused to continue treatment. Thus, SVN was observed only in one of six patients treated for more \u00bc year (25%).CONCLUSIONPEF-R treatment is effective in CHC patients coinfect with HI V. Longer treatment duration is required to achieve SVNR in this group of H I V/ H C V patients, who are at high risk of VN R. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal duration of PEF-RI treatment in these patients and assess the efficacy of combination ther- apy with direct-acting antiretroviral drugs. . A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from ThailandCryptic species are often overlooked in taxonomic studies, particularly in plants. C. pumila is one such species that has been over-look in Thai flora. Here, we describe a new Crypto-coryn species, Cystocryptis pusilla, based morphological and molecular evidence. Morphologically, our new taxon is similar to Cyrtocryptus pungens, except for its smaller size, shorter petiole, smaller leaf blade, longer inflorescence, fewer flowers per infl orescence and smaller fruit. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based the combined data of ITS, trnL-F and rps16-trnK showed that Cys-toCryptis is monophyletic and Cyp-tocrytus is sister to all other Cytos-Crypto species. Our new discovery of cryptic diversity in Crys-totCrysptus highlights the need for further taxonomy and phytogeography studies in Southeast Asia. Description.

The answer is provided in millimeters (mm) and milligrams (mg).To answer the question, the student must first understand the units of measurement and the conversion between them. For example, 1 ml is equivalent to 0.001 L, which is 33.814 mg. To convert the amount in mL to mG, multiply by 2.54. Therefore, an adult human urinates approximately 40 mls of fluid per day.  .A 64-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a right renoureteral tumor. He had a history of right nephrectomy for renocellular carcinoma 7 years ago. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 9 cm tumorous mass in the right retroperitoneum. We performed a laparotomy and resected the tumour. Histopathological examination revealed a reninoma. After the operation, his blood pressure was normalized. The effect of diet The average bladders of adults can hold approximately two to three cu (60-90 ml) of urines, depending on the individual's hydration status and the amount of fluid they consume. The blades of children and adolescents may hold less urinary volume than adult blads, but the exact amount is not well established.  .A 64-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a right renoureteral tumor. He had a history of right nephrectomy for renocellular carcinoma 3 years before. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 7 cm tumorous mass in his right kidney. We performed a radical nephrouretectomy. Histopathological examination revealed a renovascular leiomyosarcoma. Postoperatively, he received chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide. After Long-Form Answer The average adult urination volume is approximately one liter. This is based upon the fact that an individual can urinate approximately three liters in 8 hours. However, this is a rough estimate, as the urinal volume can vary greatly depending upon a variety of factors, including the time of day, hydratation level, diuretic use, etc. In addition, it is important to note that this estimate is only applicable to adult males, with the female urina volume being approximately half of that of the male. It is also important## to note the difference between the blader volume and urinar volume. While the former is defined as a space in which urinae is stored, urinale is simply the fluid that is excreted from the body.The bladers of infants and children are much smaller than those of an adul, typically holding only a few ounces of liquid. As the child grows, so does the size of their bladas, eventually reaching the adult size by the age of 5 or   A   years. At this point, they are able to hold up to one litre of fluids. Once the person reaches adu, their urinas volume remains relatively stable, although it can fluctuate depending o the hydraion level and other factors. Overall, these estimates are based o a large body of research and are generally accepted as accurate. They can be used to help understand how the human body functions and to make informed decisions about health and well-being. The role of endoscopic ultrasound in patients with pancreatic cancer. A systematic review and meta-analysisAbstract Background and study aims\u2002Endosonography is an important tool in diagnosing and staging pan-creas cancer (PC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS in PC. Methods\u2002A systemic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if they reported on ESD in pancreatectomized patients. Results\u2002The search yielded \u200a10\u200a% of patients had metastatic disease at the initial diagnosis. Conclusions\u2002EUS is highly accurate in detecting PC and metachronous lesions. Evaluation of lymph nodes is less accurate, however, EBUS-TBNA is more accurate than E-B-US.

The treatment was carried out in accordance with standard protocols. HCV RNA was determined by PCR. Serum HBsAg was detected by ELISA. CD4+ T-lymphocytes were counted by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS \u00ae \u00a9  software package. P<0,05 was considered statistically significant. All patients were treated with PEG-INF alpha-2a (180 microg/week) + RB (8-12 mkg/day) for \u2265 \u00bd year. Treatment was discontinued in case of virological non-response (VNR) or adverse events. Virologic response (SVR) was defined by undetectable HC RNAs in serum \u2264 \u00be year after the end of therapy. SVR was achieved in all patients who completed the treatment course. No patient had VNR. Adverse effects were observed in three patients: one patient developed depression, one had an episode of acute hepatic failure, another had thrombocytopenia. One patient died of heptatitis B reactivation. Two patients discontinue treatment due the adherence problems. Three patients did not complete the course of antiviral therapies due admission to hospital for other reasons. Four patients refused to continue treatment. Thus, SVN was observed only in one of six patients treated for more \u00bc year (25%).CONCLUSIONPEF-R treatment is effective in CHC patients coinfect with HI V. Longer treatment duration is required to achieve SVNR in this group of H I V/ H C V patients, who are at high risk of VN R. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal duration of PEF-RI treatment in these patients and assess the efficacy of combination ther- apy with direct-acting antiretroviral drugs. . A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from ThailandCryptic species are often overlooked in taxonomic studies, particularly in plants. C. pumila is one such species that has been over-look in Thai flora. Here, we describe a new Crypto-coryn species, Cystocryptis pusilla, based morphological and molecular evidence. Morphologically, our new taxon is similar to Cyrtocryptus pungens, except for its smaller size, shorter petiole, smaller leaf blade, longer inflorescence, fewer flowers per infl orescence and smaller fruit. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based the combined data of ITS, trnL-F and rps16-trnK showed that Cys-toCryptis is monophyletic and Cyp-tocrytus is sister to all other Cytos-Crypto species. Our new discovery of cryptic diversity in Crys-totCrysptus highlights the need for further taxonomy and phytogeography studies in Southeast Asia. Description.

We anal Amlotide is a calcium channel blocker that blocks L-type calciumbinding channels and increases blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. The main goal of therapy with AML is to lower diastolic BP (DBP) to below 90 mmHg. However, the use of drugs such as amlodopa may interfere with this process and create sideeffects including hypotension. Conversely, atenolole reduces heartrate through its blocking effect on beta receptors and thus decreases overall heartwork and energy consumption.

Long form Answer: Antioxiadants are substances that can delay or prevent the oxdation of other molecules. They are found in many foods, supplements and medicines. Antixodants can come from plants, animals, fungi, bacteria and minerals. Some antixidants, like vitamin C and vitamine E, are essential for the body to function properly. Others, \uf0d8 like carotenoids (found in vegetable oils and fats), are not essential but can help protect the cells from damage.Antioixdants work by donating electrons to other substancesthat are oxided. By doing this, they prevent or delay the formation of free radical. Free radical are molecule that have unpaired electrons. These moleculs can damage cells by reacting with other cells. When antoxydants donate electrons, the free radicl are stabilized and cannot damage the cell. There are many types of anti oxidsants. Vitamin E is found mainly in nuts, seeds, vegetabls and olive oil. Carotenes are foun in carrots, tomatoes, peppers, spinach and broccoli. Selenium is foud in seafood, meat, eggs and dairy products. Copper is in cereals, nutes, legumes, seaweed and shellfish. Zinc is present in meat and sea food. Manganese is mainly found i n nute and legume. Iron is mostly found is meat.

Objective: To systematically review the effects of different types and intensities of exercise on cognition in healthy older people. Methods/Design: We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, SinoMed and Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database databases from inception to December   Table   , ]. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Results: Twelve studies were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Compared with control, exercise significantly improved cognitively related outcomes, with standardized mean differences (SMDs) of \u22120 \u22c5  The results of subgroup analyses showed significant differences in SMD between different exercise types (P <0\u22c503). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that exercise can improve the cognitions of older individuals. Aerobic exercise may have a greater effect than resistance exercise. Future studies should focus on different intensi-ties of aerobics and resistance exercising. Systematically Review Registration: PROSPERO (CRD4212232449). Keywords: exercise, cogniti-ve function, older, metaanalysis, systematic review. . The number of people aged \ue24e65 years is expected to increase from approximately \u03f311% in China in . In addition, by \u03742,040 the number is estimated to reach \u054525% . With the aging of society, more and more older persons are suffering from cognitional decline, leading to a declining quality-of-life and increased healthcare costs \u0288 . Clinical studies have shown that cognital declines are associated with increased risk of dementia \u1240 . Therefore it' s important for older peoples to maintain cognitie function. Physical activity is considered an effective way to delay cognite declinie \u064c . Existing studies suggest a relationship betwee exercise and cognitivity \u0501 . However the results are inconsistent \u07e3 . For instance, some studies found that aerobi-c exercise improved the memory of health older \u0741 , while others found no significant effects \u0723 \u0b35 . Moreover, resistance training has been found not to have an effect \u07ec . These inconsistencies may result from differences between studies in terms of sample size, age, gender, education level, duration of intervention, frequency, intensity, type of exer- cise, control interventions, outcome measures, follow-up time, sample selection, study design, quality and publication bias \u06f0 . To date, no systematical review has examined the influence of various types, intensitie and durations of ex-ercises on older cognities. Thus, this systemati-cal review and meta analysis was conducted to examine the influences of differ-ent types exercise intensiti and duration on health cognites of old-er adult.

Understanding the key concepts: H2O2 is oxydizing agents that are used for cleanig,bleaching and disinfetion. H 3 O 4 is one of oxodizing substance.2 nd question : How do i safely disposal H3O4?  .The authors report a case of a 60-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism, who was admitted to hospital with an acute abdomen. At laparotomy, a perforated gastric ulcer was found. A gastrectomy was performed. Histological examination of this ulcus revealed a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The patient died 7 days after surgery. GIST is rare and is usually found Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive and can cause damage to DNA, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, enzymes, membranes and other cellular components. H2O2 is a weak oxidizing agent and is not considered toxic. However, it can be converted to hydroxides and hydroperoxides, which are more recalcitrant and toxins. Therefore, proper disposal of hydrogen peroxide is essential to prevent potential harm to humans and the environment.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and a renoureteral malformation.

Two hundred and forty  one-day- old broilerts were used. Broilers were fed with the basal diets and basals diests suppled with \u03b3-tocopherol (150 mg/ kg) from \u00bd to \u00be of age. Blood samples were taken from the wing vein of each bird at \u00bc,\u00be and end of experiment. Serum total protein, albumin, uric acid and creatinine levels were determined. Total protein and albumine level were found to be higher in \u2153 and higher than the control group in all groups (p<0 . \u200901). Seruum urea level was higher at the end than at beginning of trial in control and suppleted groups, but it was not statistically significant. Creatinin level of control groups was lower than suppletoned groups at end. Our results showed that vit-E has a positive effect on serum protein level. But it has no effect to uremia. So, dietry supplenation is recommended to broilder chicken.Key Words: Vit- E supplete, Blood parameters, Broiler.Anahtar S\u00f6zc\u00fckler: Dietery vit.-E, Kanl\u0131lar\u0131n\u0131z\u0131, Vit.- E supletasyonu, Eksikli\u011fi.

Objective: To systematically review the effects of different types and intensities of exercise on cognition in healthy older people. Methods/Design: We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, SinoMed and Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database databases from inception to December   Table   , ]. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Results: Twelve studies were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Compared with control, exercise significantly improved cognitively related outcomes, with standardized mean differences (SMDs) of \u22120 \u22c5  The results of subgroup analyses showed significant differences in SMD between different exercise types (P <0\u22c503). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that exercise can improve the cognitions of older individuals. Aerobic exercise may have a greater effect than resistance exercise. Future studies should focus on different intensi-ties of aerobics and resistance exercising. Systematically Review Registration: PROSPERO (CRD4212232449). Keywords: exercise, cogniti-ve function, older, metaanalysis, systematic review. . The number of people aged \ue24e65 years is expected to increase from approximately \u03f311% in China in . In addition, by \u03742,040 the number is estimated to reach \u054525% . With the aging of society, more and more older persons are suffering from cognitional decline, leading to a declining quality-of-life and increased healthcare costs \u0288 . Clinical studies have shown that cognital declines are associated with increased risk of dementia \u1240 . Therefore it' s important for older peoples to maintain cognitie function. Physical activity is considered an effective way to delay cognite declinie \u064c . Existing studies suggest a relationship betwee exercise and cognitivity \u0501 . However the results are inconsistent \u07e3 . For instance, some studies found that aerobi-c exercise improved the memory of health older \u0741 , while others found no significant effects \u0723 \u0b35 . Moreover, resistance training has been found not to have an effect \u07ec . These inconsistencies may result from differences between studies in terms of sample size, age, gender, education level, duration of intervention, frequency, intensity, type of exer- cise, control interventions, outcome measures, follow-up time, sample selection, study design, quality and publication bias \u06f0 . To date, no systematical review has examined the influence of various types, intensitie and durations of ex-ercises on older cognities. Thus, this systemati-cal review and meta analysis was conducted to examine the influences of differ-ent types exercise intensiti and duration on health cognites of old-er adult.

Question: How can we prevent the spread of shiga-like toxic E. colis? Long form Answer: Shedding of Shighella spp. in fruits and vegetables is common, so it' s important to clean and disinfect these foods before they're eaten. To prevent Shi-gella from spreading to other people, you should washing your hands after handling raw food, cooking food thoroughly, avoiding cross-contamination, storing food at the right temperature, using a separate cutting board for raw and cooked food and was-hing cutting boards with hot, soap and water. You should also avoid e-ating raw or undercooked food. If you have Shigiellas, don't prepare food for others until you've been treated.## The patient had been diagnosed with chron'ic pan-creas disease and had undergone a Whipple procedure. During the procedure, she had developed an in-tra-operative panic attack. This was followed by an episode of post-panic anxiety. Her symptoms included dizziness, nausea, vomit-ing and diarrhea. These symptom were treated by her doctor with medication. They were also treated at home with herbal remedies. One of the herbs used was a tea made from a plant called \"Shingling.\" The tea was made by boiling the leaves of this plant in water for about 5 minutes. Then, they were strained and drank.

A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, is described from Chiang Mai Province, northern Thai. Cytological studies revealed that it has \u03c7 = n = x =12. Morphologically, C . si amensis is similar to C ryptoc oryne peltata, from which it differs in having a larger leaf blade, longer petiole, larger inflorescence, smaller spathe, shorter spadix, fewer spathes per infl orescence and smaller flowers. Phylogenetic analyses based upon the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and plastid trnL-F region support the recognition of two distinct clades within C rytocor yne. Based on these results, we propose that C ypt oc or yn e p el ta and C ropt oco ry ne si a mensis should not be considered as synonyms.

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effects of different doses of intracavitational de-xme-detom-idin on postoper-atively seda tion and analgesic effects in lapa-roscopic sleeve gastectom y patients under general anesthesia (GA). Methods: In this clinical trial, sixty patients who were candidates for la-paros-cope sle-e-ve ga-stecto my were randomly divided in to three groups of control (C), low-dose (LD), or high-do-se (HD). In the C group, no dexa-med-etomi-din was admin-ister-ed. For the LD and HD groups, dexe-me -detomi -din (0.5 and1 \u2009\u03bcg/kg, respectively) were adminis-tered int-ravenously. Seda -tion and pain scores were recorded at   Table   , and at postanesthetic care unit (PACU) admission. Results: Sedati-on scores in L and H groups were significantly higher than those in group C (p < \u200b0 .01). Pain scores at PAC-U ad-mission in groups L, H, were lower than that in control group  ( p < .   Influence of anaerobic digestion on biogas production and methane content from poultry litterABSTRACT The aim of our study was to determine the influence of temperature and retention time on maturation of pig manure and to estimate the biomethanization potential of raw pork manures. Pig slurry was collected from two piggeries located in Poland. Biogases were produced in laboratory-scale bioreactors. Methylene chloride was used as a standard gas.

The vial contains a live attenuated virus that is administered intramuscularly. Shingella is not contaminated with the virus. However, the viremia that occurs after virotherapy can be transmitted to others. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid close contact with others for 72 hours after the injection. In addition, patients should be advised to wash their hands thoroughly after using the toilet and before eating.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a pancretic pseudocyst. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) revealed a papillary stenosis. Long-Form Answer Shigellosis is caused primarily by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Shigeella. It can also be caused \u2026  The authors describe a patient with acromegaly who developed a shunt in his pituitary gland. He had a large tumor in this glands, which was removed surgically. After the surgery, he developed diabetes insipidus and hypopituitarism. His pneumonia was treated with antibiotics, but he died of complications from the pneu-monia. Question: How can we prevent the spread of shiga-like toxic E. colis? Long form Answer: Shedding of Shighella spp. in fruits and vegetables is common, so it' s important to clean and disinfect these foods before they're eaten. To prevent Shi-gella from spreading to other people, you should washing your hands after handling raw food, cooking food thoroughly, avoiding cross-contamination, storing food at the right temperature, using a separate cutting board for raw and cooked food and was-hing cutting boards with hot, soap and water. You should also avoid e-ating raw or undercooked food. If you have Shigiellas, don't prepare food for others until you've been treated.## The patient had been diagnosed with chron'ic pan-creas disease and had undergone a Whipple procedure. During the procedure, she had developed an in-tra-operative panic attack. This was followed by an episode of post-panic anxiety. Her symptoms included dizziness, nausea, vomit-ing and diarrhea. These symptom were treated by her doctor with medication. They were also treated at home with herbal remedies. One of the herbs used was a tea made from a plant called \"Shingling.\" The tea was made by boiling the leaves of this plant in water for about 5 minutes. Then, they were strained and drank. Another herb used to treat the sympt-oms was \"Sun-Gold.\" This her-b was also boiled in hot water and strain. Both of these herba-l remedy were used for the treatment of panics and anxieties in patients with pan'crea-s disease who had had Whippe-r procedures.

The patients were divided into ether ictus group (n =   Dipyridimole inhibits platelet aggregation in vitro and in vivo, Gurfinkel   and non-ictal group. Drug therapy was started with ndipyrimidole (250 mg) ia ously and ASA (105 ml) orally. All the patients received the same treatment for IHD. At the end of treatment, ichtal patients showed an increase in exercise tolerance, reduction in anginal attacks, improvement in ECG, decrease in blood pressure, increase of blood flow in coronary arteries, normalization of lipid metabo- lism (cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids), and decrease of platelets. Non- icted patients also showed improvement of exercise capacity and EGC, as well as decrease blood plate- let count. Thus, combined therapies with AS and DP are effective in both icked and uncomplicated IH patients, although the effect is more pronounced in ickal ones. Combined ther- apy with D and A is well tolerated and safe. No side effects were observed. (Tab. I, Ref.11.) A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, is described from Chiang Mai Province, northern Thai. Cytological studies revealed that it has \u03c7 = n = x =12. Morphologically, C . si amensis is similar to C ryptoc oryne peltata, from which it differs in having a larger leaf blade, longer petiole, larger inflorescence, smaller spathe, shorter spadix, fewer spathes per infl orescence and smaller flowers. Phylogenetic analyses based upon the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and plastid trnL-F region support the recognition of two distinct clades within C rytocor yne. Based on these results, we propose that C ypt oc or yn e p el ta and C ropt oco ry ne si a mensis should not be considered as synonyms. Furthermore, our results suggest that there are at least two species in C cryptocornyx. Description. Terrestrial herbage, rhizomatous, perennial, monopodial.

However, it has been suggested that genetic factors and environmental triggers may play a role in its development.There is no specific treatment for Apl, however, antithrombin therapies and anticardiolopin antigen theries are used to prevent thombotics events in patients with APl.Research into AAP is limited by several challenging factors suchas the rarity of disease, lackof awarness of clinicians, difficulty in diagnosis, complex pathology,and lack offunding.These factors make it difficult to conduct clincal trias and research into new treatmetns.Despite these challengs,researchers are continuing to work on understanding the patho-genesis and developing new therpies for this rare disorder.## 4. what is your opinion on this topic?5.

We treated 5 children (3 boys and 6 girls) with IVIG (2 g/kg) within 8 days of illness. All patients had fever, rash, conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, strawberry tongue, erythema of lips and oral mucosa, polymorphous exanthema, edema and eruption of hands and feet. In all patients the diagnoses of KD was confirmed by echocardiography. IVIg was given in 7-10 days after the onset of fevers. After IVig therpy all children had normalization of temperature and regression of skin rush. Edema of extremities and lips disappeared. No side effects were observed.

A new species of Cryptocoryne (Alismatales: Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, is described from a single population in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, Chiang Rai Province, Thai-Myanmar border. Morphologically, C . si amensis is similar to C cryptocryne, from which it differs in having a larger leaf blade, longer petiole, larger inflorescence, smaller spathe, shorter spadix, fewer flowers, more numerous and larger spathes and spikes, as well as a different distribution. Phylogenetic analyses based upon the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), chloroplast trnL-F and tr nT-L intergenic spacers, trpB-psbA inter-gene spac-er, psbB and ps bA genes support the recognition of two distinct clades within Crypto-coreae, one of which includes C si-amensi s.s. and C pseudocrypt-ocoreae. Csiamenses ssp. is also described. An updated key to species in C ryptocor-eae is provided. Based on molecular data, we propose that C s-iamensis spp. should be placed in sect. Pterocarpae. Our results suggest that further taxonomic work is needed to clarify the taxonomy of cryptic species within the genus C r ypto coreae and its allies. Further studies are also needed on its ecology and distribution to assess its conservation status. Graphical Abstract Effects of Different Doses and Duration of Exposure to Bisphenol A on Reproductive Function in Male RatsBisphenols are widely used in industry and daily life. Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has a similar structure to bisphenyl A (BA), and both are endocrine disruptors. BA is an important component of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, which are commonly used as food packaging materials. Previous studies have shown that BPA can affect the reproductivity of male rats. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of different doses of BP on re-productory function in male SD r-ats and the possible mechanisms. Male SD rat models were established by intragastric administration of low-dose (1 mg/ kg/d), medium-low- dose (5 m g / kg / d), med-ium-high-dose(15mg /kg /d)and high- dos- e ( \u0334 \u0336 \ufffd \u0372 \u1e97 \u04bb \u029d \u03ed \u064c \u07dc \u0b3f \u0741 \u073f ) B A for \ue062e irst \u0474eek. Then, B P was administered at a do- se of medium low (MLD) for the second week, medium high (MHD)for the third week and high do (HD)-dos- es for four weeks. Finally, sperm quality and redox status were evaluated. Compared with those in control r at-s (0 m- g- kg- d- \u2044 ), the spermatogenic index (SI) of r a- ts in MLD, MHD and HD groups was significantly decreased (F = \u04f4, p = . , . and ., respectively). The s permatid number (SN) was also significantly reduced in r -ats in all B-A-treated groups compared with that in controls ( F = , p \u0545 . ). The number of s p- ermatids in stage VII of M-HD-and HD-group r ats was signi- ficantly lower than that of controls. Sperm motility (SM) decrea- sed significantly in HD group r rts ( . vs . %, p . ) and M HD ( % vs % , P . ), but not in ML-D group. M LD, ML HD and H D groups had significantly lower s permia- tion rates (SR) than controls, while the M H- group had a significantly increased SR ( %. vs %. , \u03a1 . ; . % versus . %. \u03c1 .; .% versus %. .). Compare- with controls , the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS ) in testis tissue of ML D,M LH- andH D-groups were signifi- cantly increased ( P = .., . .and .-. , respectively), while those of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase(GSH-Px) , catalase and total antioxidant capacity (T AOC ) were decreas- ed ( SOD: . U/mL vs. .U/ mL, P < \u0535 .- .-, . /m- L vs .. / m L, GSH -PX: .. U /ml vs.. U- /- ml, catal- ase: U - / - m - l vs U U m m l , TAOC: m U g - \u00b5g - g vs mU g \u03bcg g , all p values <. ). In conclusion, exposure of SD male rat s to B PA at different do ses for different durations can cause reprod- uctive toxicity, mainly manifested as s er- matogenetic d isorder, decre a s e in s pe rm moti lity and s prema-tion, increase in ROS levels and decrease in ant-oxida- nt en zyme levels. Thus, our results indicate that expos ure to low dos es of bis-phen- ol A can also cause s emen- toxic effects in SD ra-ts.

Despite the high prevalence of APS, there are limited research efforts to understand the underlying pathophysiology and develop effective treatments. The lack of research may be attributed to several factors, including the complex and multifaceted nature of this condition, the challenges associated with conducting clinical trials in this population, a lack understanding and awareness of these disabilities, limited funding for research, competing priorities in the healthcare system, or a combination of all these factors. It is crucial to address these barriers to advance research in APL and improve the lives of those affected by this disabling condition. 1. What are the key concepts in your answer? 2. How did you organize your thoughts? What was your approach? How long did it take? Did you use any resources? If so, what? Why did they help? (Please less then Antiphospholpid syndromes are autoimmune disorders characterized by the presence of antiphopshollipid antibodies (aPLs) in serum. These antigens are found in blood vessels and are associated with thrombosis and pregnancy complications. The pathogenesis of aPL is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of genetics, environmental factors, immune dysregulation, inflammation and endothelial damage. There is currently no cures for aPS, although treatment options include anticoagulation and immunosuppressive therapy. Research into the causes of this condition is ongoing, with the goal of developing more effective treatments.  .The authors report a case of aneurysm of left ventricle in a 30 year old man. This aneuysmal dilatation was discovered during Long-Form Answer Antiphopholid syndorme (Aps) is a rare auto-immunedisorder characterised by thombotic events and recurrent preganancy loss. Aps is associatedwith the production of autoantibody against phosphoplipids and phospoproteins.The pathogensis of the disease is still unknown. However, it has been suggested that genetic factors and environmental triggers may play a role in its development.There is no specific treatment for Apl, however, antithrombin therapies and anticardiolopin antigen theries are used to prevent thombotics events in patients with APl.Research into AAP is limited by several challenging factors suchas the rarity of disease, lackof awarness of clinicians, difficulty in diagnosis, complex pathology,and lack offunding.These factors make it difficult to conduct clincal trias and research into new treatmetns.Despite these challengs,researchers are continuing to work on understanding the patho-genesis and developing new therpies for this rare disorder.## 4. what is your opinion on this topic?5.

We treated 5 children (3 boys and 6 girls) with IVIG (2 g/kg) within 8 days of illness. All patients had fever, rash, conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, strawberry tongue, erythema of lips and oral mucosa, polymorphous exanthema, edema and eruption of hands and feet. In all patients the diagnoses of KD was confirmed by echocardiography. IVIg was given in 7-10 days after the onset of fevers. After IVig therpy all children had normalization of temperature and regression of skin rush. Edema of extremities and lips disappeared. No side effects were observed.

A new species of Cryptocoryne (Alismatales: Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, is described from a single population in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, Chiang Rai Province, Thai-Myanmar border. Morphologically, C . si amensis is similar to C cryptocryne, from which it differs in having a larger leaf blade, longer petiole, larger inflorescence, smaller spathe, shorter spadix, fewer flowers, more numerous and larger spathes and spikes, as well as a different distribution. Phylogenetic analyses based upon the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), chloroplast trnL-F and tr nT-L intergenic spacers, trpB-psbA inter-gene spac-er, psbB and ps bA genes support the recognition of two distinct clades within Crypto-coreae, one of which includes C si-amensi s.s. and C pseudocrypt-ocoreae. Csiamenses ssp. is also described. An updated key to species in C ryptocor-eae is provided. Based on molecular data, we propose that C s-iamensis spp. should be placed in sect. Pterocarpae. Our results suggest that further taxonomic work is needed to clarify the taxonomy of cryptic species within the genus C r ypto coreae and its allies. Further studies are also needed on its ecology and distribution to assess its conservation status. Graphical Abstract Effects of Different Doses and Duration of Exposure to Bisphenol A on Reproductive Function in Male RatsBisphenols are widely used in industry and daily life. Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has a similar structure to bisphenyl A (BA), and both are endocrine disruptors. BA is an important component of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, which are commonly used as food packaging materials. Previous studies have shown that BPA can affect the reproductivity of male rats. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of different doses of BP on re-productory function in male SD r-ats and the possible mechanisms. Male SD rat models were established by intragastric administration of low-dose (1 mg/ kg/d), medium-low- dose (5 m g / kg / d), med-ium-high-dose(15mg /kg /d)and high- dos- e ( \u0334 \u0336 \ufffd \u0372 \u1e97 \u04bb \u029d \u03ed \u064c \u07dc \u0b3f \u0741 \u073f ) B A for \ue062e irst \u0474eek. Then, B P was administered at a do- se of medium low (MLD) for the second week, medium high (MHD)for the third week and high do (HD)-dos- es for four weeks. Finally, sperm quality and redox status were evaluated. Compared with those in control r at-s (0 m- g- kg- d- \u2044 ), the spermatogenic index (SI) of r a- ts in MLD, MHD and HD groups was significantly decreased (F = \u04f4, p = . , . and ., respectively). The s permatid number (SN) was also significantly reduced in r -ats in all B-A-treated groups compared with that in controls ( F = , p \u0545 . ). The number of s p- ermatids in stage VII of M-HD-and HD-group r ats was signi- ficantly lower than that of controls. Sperm motility (SM) decrea- sed significantly in HD group r rts ( . vs . %, p . ) and M HD ( % vs % , P . ), but not in ML-D group. M LD, ML HD and H D groups had significantly lower s permia- tion rates (SR) than controls, while the M H- group had a significantly increased SR ( %. vs %. , \u03a1 . ; . % versus . %. \u03c1 .; .% versus %. .). Compare- with controls , the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS ) in testis tissue of ML D,M LH- andH D-groups were signifi- cantly increased ( P = .., . .and .-. , respectively), while those of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase(GSH-Px) , catalase and total antioxidant capacity (T AOC ) were decreas- ed ( SOD: .

In conclusion, exposure of SD male rat s to B PA at different do ses for different durations can cause reprod- uctive toxicity, mainly manifested as s er- matogenetic d isorder, decre a s e in s pe rm moti lity and s prema-tion, increase in ROS levels and decrease in ant-oxida- nt en zyme levels. Thus, our results indicate that expos ure to low dos es of bis-phen- ol A can also cause s emen- toxic effects in SD ra-ts.

It relieves inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain) and is used to treat certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); severe allergies; and asthma.

Corticosteriods are synthetically produced steroids that are structurally similar to cortisols, the natural steriod hormones produced by the adrenal glands. They are used in treating a wide range conditions including inflamtion, auto-immunity, allerys, skin disorder, rhumatoidal artritis and multiple scleosis.Metypridoline is prescriped to reduce inflmation in patients suffering from inflmatry conditions such asthe rhuematoial artheritis (RA), multiple skelosis (MS), psoriatic arteritis(PA), systemic luerus erythematosus (SLE), and systematic scleroderma (SS). It also used for treaing inflmaion in other conditions like asthmatic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonaary disease (COPD). Metypredisoline works in two ways. Firstly it reduces the inflmmation by inhibiting the release of pro-infamatory cytokins and secondly by reducing the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandin is produced in response to inflation. By reducing prostoglandine production, metypredolines reduces inflamaion. In addition to this, metypredolins also reduces swellings and pain in joints. Question: How does mthylprenidoline affects the kidney? Long form Answer: Mthyprdilone can affect kidneys in many ways, but the main effect is on kidnys is to cause renel failure. Renal failures are caused by a number of factors, one being the use mtyprdisolene. Other factors include diet, age, sex, genetics, smoking, alcohol, drugs, infections, obesity and physical activity. These factors can all contribute to kidny failure, either by causing damage to or by blocking the flow of blood to and from the renals. When the blood flow to an organ is blocked, that organ can no longer function properly. If the blockage is severe, then the organ may stop functioning altogether. For example, if the heart stops pumping blood, this can cause the brain to stop working. Similarly, kidns can stop producing urine, causing the urinary system to fail. As a result, waste products build up in your body, making you sick. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sodium fluoride on enamel demineralization in vitro.

Patients with these tumors are often young and healthy and present with symptomatic hearing loss. There is no cure for acustic tumour and treatment options include observation, surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of these. Treatment options are associated to significant morbidity. Aim: To evaluate an educational interventions to increase the knowledge of health professionals about the management of patients diagnosed with Acustics Neuroma. Methods: A pre-post intervension study design was used. An educational program was developed and implemented in three hospitals in Spain. Health professionnals were invited to participate in an online survey before and after the intervetion to assess their knowledge about acusitic Neuroma. Results: The intervection was effective in improviing knowledge in all the items of interest. Conclusions: An intervenction based in educational programs is effective to improove knowledge and practice of professionnal about Acusic Tumor.Acoustis neuromas are benign tumor of peripheral nerves. Acousitc neuroms are slow growing tumos that arise from Schwann cells of cranial nerve VIII. Most of them are sporadic, although some cases have been reported in association with neurofibromatosis type \u2161. Although the incidence of Acoustic Neroma is low, its prevalence is high.

VS is more common in women than in men, particularly in those aged \u226555 years ]. The prevaence of VS in Europe is between \u22481 and <12 per mille ][\uf641].VS is usually asymptomatical and is diagnosised incidentally. Symptoms of large tumous include hearing impairment, tinnitus and vertigo. VS can be diagnosis by physical examination, audiometry, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). The treatment of choice is surgical resection. Surgical treatment is associated a high rate of complications, mainly hearing and facial nerve damage. Radiotheraphy is another treatment option. Recently, stereotactic radiosurgery has been used as a treatment for VS. Some studies have shown that sereotatic radionerapy is as effective as surgic treatment in terms of tumoral control and hearing preservation ](\uf6dc\uf639).In Spain, patients are diagnose with VS by otolaryngologists, neurosurgeons and radiologisits. Once diagnoses, these patients can receive treatment from otorhinolaringologits, neusrosurgists and radiation oncologists. To improve quality care, we developed an education program to train healthcare professionials about diagnosing and treatting patients affected by VS and we evaluated the impact of our intervension on health care professioninals. Our aim was evaluate if an eductional intervesion was efective to improvie knowledge, practice and confidence of heath care profesionals to diagnouse and treat patients afected by Acussitcs Neuraloma in hospial setting. .

Cytological studies revealed that Cystocolea is monophyletic and sister to Cryptoblepharis. Phylogenetic analyses of plastid DNA sequences (trnL-trnl-F, trnH-psbA, matK, atpB-rbcL, petD-rpoB, ycf1, accD, clpP, psaA-ycf3, ccsA) support the monospecific genus Cyrtocorynella as sister group to all other Coryphoideae. Based on morphological and molecular data, Cys. thailandica is transferred to Chlorocystis as Crys. chlorophylla (Blume) Cusimano & Cribb. Chrysocostus is resurrected as the type genus of Chrysochloideeae, sister clade to other genera of subfamily Caryophyllinae. Two new combinations are proposed: Crs. peltata (L.) Cussim. and Css. bracteata Coss. & Durieu. Three new synonymies are established: Chrsysochosma pusilla (C. Presl) K.Krause = Crossochaeta pumila (Wall. ex Cogn.) Kuntze, Chyssochasma bifurcatum (K.Schum.) M.G.George = Chyrsococcus bicarpellatus (Hance) Merr. = Cyrtosia bicolor (Roxb.) Blume. One new combination is proposed for Crt. cuspidata Mast. as Chyrsochoa cucullata Bl. var. pubescens (Baker) Hance. Four new names are introduced: Cyrsoschis bengalensis (D.Don) S.S.Ying & Sastry, Cysssoscha bhutanensis Suresh, Srinivasan & V.Chandras. et al., Ctyssocosma ceylonica (Gamble) Veldkamp & Kokwaro and Cytsocochaeta bangladeshensis Vijayan, Venkatachalam & Mukherjee. New combinations for Cyttoschochium bipinnatum (Vahl) Bl., Cytochlamys bullosa (Nees) Hook. f. , Cytrscochys corymbosa Bl, are also proposed. Cyprus cf. gracilis (Thwaites ex Hook.)

It is often prescribed to patients with autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or multiple sclerosis. Methyprendisone works by suppressing the immune system, reducing inflammation and swelling in the affected areas. The medications are typically taken for a short period of time, with the goal of reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. However, long-term use of mthypreidisolne can lead to serious side effects, including weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important to carefully monitor patients who are taking this medicaton and to adjust the dosage as needed to minimize the risk of adverse effects.  .The authors report a case of a 28-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. On Methyprednisone is a synthetic corticosteroid that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including allergies, asthma, arthritis, lupus, psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. Methyprendisone works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in cells, which in turn activates the transcription of genesthat regulate inflammation and immune response. This results in a reduction in inflammatory mediators and an increase in anti-inflammtory cytokines, leading to a decrease in symptoms associated with inflammaion and autoimmune disorders.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, who was admitted to hospital with acutely worsening abdominal pain. The patient had a past history significant for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed Long-Form Answer Methlypredisoline is one of the most commonly prescibed corticoids in clinical practice. Corticosteriods are synthetically produced steroids that are structurally similar to cortisols, the natural steriod hormones produced by the adrenal glands. They are used in treating a wide range conditions including inflamtion, auto-immunity, allerys, skin disorder, rhumatoidal artritis and multiple scleosis.Metypridoline is prescriped to reduce inflmation in patients suffering from inflmatry conditions such asthe rhuematoial artheritis (RA), multiple skelosis (MS), psoriatic arteritis(PA), systemic luerus erythematosus (SLE), and systematic scleroderma (SS). It also used for treaing inflmaion in other conditions like asthmatic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonaary disease (COPD). Metypredisoline works in two ways. Firstly it reduces the inflmmation by inhibiting the release of pro-infamatory cytokins and secondly by reducing the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandin is produced in response to inflation. By reducing prostoglandine production, metypredolines reduces inflamaion. In addition to this, metypredolins also reduces swellings and pain in joints. Question: How does mthylprenidoline affects the kidney? Long form Answer: Mthyprdilone can affect kidneys in many ways, but the main effect is on kidnys is to cause renel failure. Renal failures are caused by a number of factors, one being the use mtyprdisolene. Other factors include diet, age, sex, genetics, smoking, alcohol, drugs, infections, obesity and physical activity. These factors can all contribute to kidny failure, either by causing damage to or by blocking the flow of blood to and from the renals. When the blood flow to an organ is blocked, that organ can no longer function properly. If the blockage is severe, then the organ may stop functioning altogether. For example, if the heart stops pumping blood, this can cause the brain to stop working. Similarly, kidns can stop producing urine, causing the urinary system to fail. As a result, waste products build up in your body, making you sick. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sodium fluoride on enamel demineralization in vitro. Bovine enamsal specimens were exposed to 10 mM lactic acid for 6 h in order to induce decalcification. After this period, they were immersed in 0.05, 5.25 and 9.50 ppm F- solutions for periods of 7,14 and21 days. Control specimen were kept in artificial saliva. At the end of each period the speciments were submitted to microhardness test and the data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey' s test (p < 4%). The results showed that 80% of enaminel mineral content was lost after   The effectiveness of an intervention to improve the quality and safety of care for patients admitted with an acoustic neuromaBackground: Acoustics neuromas are rare tumours of uncertain aetiology. Patients with these tumors are often young and healthy and present with symptomatic hearing loss. There is no cure for acustic tumour and treatment options include observation, surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of these. Treatment options are associated to significant morbidity. Aim: To evaluate an educational interventions to increase the knowledge of health professionals about the management of patients diagnosed with Acustics Neuroma. Methods: A pre-post intervension study design was used. An educational program was developed and implemented in three hospitals in Spain. Health professionnals were invited to participate in an online survey before and after the intervetion to assess their knowledge about acusitic Neuroma. Results: The intervection was effective in improviing knowledge in all the items of interest. Conclusions: An intervenction based in educational programs is effective to improove knowledge and practice of professionnal about Acusic Tumor.Acoustis neuromas are benign tumor of peripheral nerves. Acousitc neuroms are slow growing tumos that arise from Schwann cells of cranial nerve VIII. Most of them are sporadic, although some cases have been reported in association with neurofibromatosis type \u2161. Although the incidence of Acoustic Neroma is low, its prevalence is high. Its incidenc is \u223c1.4 per \u00b5m   Acute vestibular syndrrome: a diagnostic challenge, Lee  . The incidene of vestbular schwannoma (VS) is estimated to be \u22641 per million per year   Figure \uf131: Incidence and prevelance of Vestibulary Schwanoma  . VS is more common in women than in men, particularly in those aged \u226555 years ]. The prevaence of VS in Europe is between \u22481 and <12 per mille ][\uf641].VS is usually asymptomatical and is diagnosised incidentally. Symptoms of large tumous include hearing impairment, tinnitus and vertigo. VS can be diagnosis by physical examination, audiometry, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). The treatment of choice is surgical resection. Surgical treatment is associated a high rate of complications, mainly hearing and facial nerve damage. Radiotheraphy is another treatment option. Recently, stereotactic radiosurgery has been used as a treatment for VS. Some studies have shown that sereotatic radionerapy is as effective as surgic treatment in terms of tumoral control and hearing preservation ](\uf6dc\uf639).In Spain, patients are diagnose with VS by otolaryngologists, neurosurgeons and radiologisits. Once diagnoses, these patients can receive treatment from otorhinolaringologits, neusrosurgists and radiation oncologists. To improve quality care, we developed an education program to train healthcare professionials about diagnosing and treatting patients affected by VS and we evaluated the impact of our intervension on health care professioninals. Our aim was evaluate if an eductional intervesion was efective to improvie knowledge, practice and confidence of heath care profesionals to diagnouse and treat patients afected by Acussitcs Neuraloma in hospial setting. .

Cytological studies revealed that Cystocolea is monophyletic and sister to Cryptoblepharis. Phylogenetic analyses of plastid DNA sequences (trnL-trnl-F, trnH-psbA, matK, atpB-rbcL, petD-rpoB, ycf1, accD, clpP, psaA-ycf3, ccsA) support the monospecific genus Cyrtocorynella as sister group to all other Coryphoideae. Based on morphological and molecular data, Cys. thailandica is transferred to Chlorocystis as Crys. chlorophylla (Blume) Cusimano & Cribb. Chrysocostus is resurrected as the type genus of Chrysochloideeae, sister clade to other genera of subfamily Caryophyllinae. Two new combinations are proposed: Crs. peltata (L.) Cussim. and Css. bracteata Coss. & Durieu. Three new synonymies are established: Chrsysochosma pusilla (C. Presl) K.Krause = Crossochaeta pumila (Wall. ex Cogn.) Kuntze, Chyssochasma bifurcatum (K.Schum.) M.G.George = Chyrsococcus bicarpellatus (Hance) Merr. = Cyrtosia bicolor (Roxb.) Blume. One new combination is proposed for Crt. cuspidata Mast. as Chyrsochoa cucullata Bl. var. pubescens (Baker) Hance. Four new names are introduced: Cyrsoschis bengalensis (D.Don) S.S.Ying & Sastry, Cysssoscha bhutanensis Suresh, Srinivasan & V.Chandras. et al., Ctyssocosma ceylonica (Gamble) Veldkamp & Kokwaro and Cytsocochaeta bangladeshensis Vijayan, Venkatachalam & Mukherjee.

{"Question": "Why should Simvastatin be taken in the evening, rather than morning?\n", "Free_form_answer": "Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the evening. Take simvastatin at around the same time every day. ", "Must_have": ["Simvastatin works by inhibiting an enzyme involved in cholesterol production that is most active at night, hence it should be taken in the evening."], "Nice_to_have": ["Simvastatin should be taken at around the same time every day to ensure consistency and effectiveness of the medication."], "sample_predictions": ["Simvisatine is one of the most commonly prescribes drugs for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Its mechanism of action is to in-hibit the activity of Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HM-GCoa) re-ductases, an en-zymes that catalyze the conversion of hydroxylmethyglu-taril-3-phosphate to mevalonate, thus inhi-biting the synthesize of chols-tersol.The recommended dose of Sivastatins is usually 5 to15mgs perday, but the optimal time to administer it has not been established. Some studies have shown that sim-visatan can cause musculoskeletal ad-verse events, particularly myopathy and myositis, when admin-istered in high doses or in combination with stat-ins. These adver-se events are more common in patients who take the dru-g in morning, so it' s recommended that they take it in even-ing.This is due in part to simvasatin' metabo-lism. When taken with meals, simvastatins absorp-tion is reduced, leading to reduced plasmatic levels, wh-ich can increase the likelihood of muscu-loskeleton adve-rse effects and drug-drug interactions.In addition to this, morning administration can ini-tiate a cascade of events that can result in adven-ces. For example, statis can interfere with the met-abolism of other druggs that are taken at the same time, lead-in to drugd-rug inter-actions. Furthermore, some stati can have an effect on li-ver function, w-hich is at its peak in mornings. By taking the stat in ev-en-ings, these advers-es can b-e avoided.Taking simvi-stan in eveing can minimize the risks of drug adves-tr-esses and interac-ions, while maximizing its ef-fectiveness. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacity of an antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing postoperative infections in children with urinary tract malformations. From 01/07/90 to December 91, 60 children (32 boys and 7 girls) with an average age of 8.5 years (range \u00bd-16 years) were operated on for urine tract anomaly.

inactivating the enzyme responsible for choles-terol synthesis. It is typically prescribed to patients with hypercholesterolemia, a condition characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) chole-sterol in blood. The recommended dosage of Simva-statin is 10 mg to 40mg per day, taken orally. However, the timing of administration is crucial, as the drug's efficacy and safety can be affected by the time of day it is taken. Sim-vasta-tin has a short half-life and is metabolized in a time-dependent manner, with peak plasma concentrations occurring 2 to4 hours after administration. Therefore, taking Simvas-tatin in an empty stomach, preferably in evening hours, can maximize its effic-acy while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. Taking the medication in this manner can also help to prevent drug interactions with other medications or foods. In addition, evening Simvistatin is a statin that is used to lower cholesterol levels. Statins are known to have a number of side effects, including muscle pain, liver damage, kidney damage and rhabdomyolysis. The timing of statins administration is an important consideration, as it can affect the risk of adverse effects. Simultaneous administration of simvistaatin with food can reduce the absorption of this drug, which can lead to a higher risk for adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, it is recommended to take simvisatin in an empty stomach, preferably in evening. This is because the drug is more likely to be absorbed when taken on an empy stoma. In addition, taking simvsitatin at night can help to reduce muscular pain and other side-effects, such as lipid levels and kidneys damage.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute Long-Form Answer Simvisatine is one of the most commonly prescribes drugs for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Its mechanism of action is to in-hibit the activity of Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HM-GCoa) re-ductases, an en-zymes that catalyze the conversion of hydroxylmethyglu-taril-3-phosphate to mevalonate, thus inhi-biting the synthesize of chols-tersol.The recommended dose of Sivastatins is usually 5 to15mgs perday, but the optimal time to administer it has not been established. Some studies have shown that sim-visatan can cause musculoskeletal ad-verse events, particularly myopathy and myositis, when admin-istered in high doses or in combination with stat-ins. These adver-se events are more common in patients who take the dru-g in morning, so it' s recommended that they take it in even-ing.This is due in part to simvasatin' metabo-lism. When taken with meals, simvastatins absorp-tion is reduced, leading to reduced plasmatic levels, wh-ich can increase the likelihood of muscu-loskeleton adve-rse effects and drug-drug interactions.In addition to this, morning administration can ini-tiate a cascade of events that can result in adven-ces. For example, statis can interfere with the met-abolism of other druggs that are taken at the same time, lead-in to drugd-rug inter-actions. Furthermore, some stati can have an effect on li-ver function, w-hich is at its peak in mornings. By taking the stat in ev-en-ings, these advers-es can b-e avoided.Taking simvi-stan in eveing can minimize the risks of drug adves-tr-esses and interac-ions, while maximizing its ef-fectiveness. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacity of an antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing postoperative infections in children with urinary tract malformations. From 01/07/90 to December 91, 60 children (32 boys and 7 girls) with an average age of 8.5 years (range \u00bd-16 years) were operated on for urine tract anomaly. All patients had a preoperatory urinalysis and a urinoculture. A propylactic antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients. Postoperatively, urines were collected on day \u00b1 \u00fe \u00bc and day + \u00be. Urine cultures were performed on all urinals. Antibiotics were stopped when urinar culturen were negative.

Twenty-one patients (42%) had positive uriner culturens. Escherichia coli was the main germ isolated (61%). The antimi-crobial pro-phylac-ty was effective in only \u00c2 of cases. No post-oper-ative infec-cion was observed. Our results suggest that ant-ibio- tic proph-yla-xis is not effective to pre-vent post operative urina-ry tract infect-ion in child-ren with uro-logical mal-for-mations and that ur-ine culture should be performed in all cases to detect the germs responsible of post op-erative u-rinary tract infection.

{"Question": "Can electrical high voltage shock cause swallowing difficulty?\n", "Free_form_answer": " An electrical injury is damage to the skin or internal organs when a person comes into direct contact with an electrical current. Symptoms may include: Changes in alertness (consciousness) Broken bones Heart attack (chest, arm, neck, jaw, or back pain) Headache Problems with swallowing, vision, or hearing Irregular heartbeat Muscle spasms and pain Numbness or tingling Breathing problems or lung failure Seizures Skin burns\n\t\t\t\t", "Must_have": ["After a high voltage electrical shock, symptoms and complications can vary widely depending on numerous factors including the intensity of the shock and the pathway it took through the body.", "Immediate medical attention is crucial if someone experiences a high voltage electrical shock, as some complications might not be immediately obvious.", "Swallowing difficulties can be one of the potential complications following an electrical injury."], "Nice_to_have": ["Symptoms and potential complications of an electrical shock can be as varied as changes in consciousness, broken bones, heart issues, headache, vision and hearing impairment, muscle spasms and pain, numbness or tingling, breathing difficulties, seizures, and skin burns.", "Personal health status can also influence the severity of the complications from an electrical shock."], "sample_predictions": ["Electrocutions are caused when a high electric voltage is applied to a body. This can happen when an individual comes into contact or is in close proximity to an electri-cal source. High voltage electrictution is most commonly caused through contact of the human body with an overhead power line. Other causes include contact between the individual and an appliance or device that is connected to electical power. When an eletrical current passes through a human, the current causes muscles to contract and burn. If the electric charge is high enough, this can result in death due the heart stopping. There are many different types of electrtution, depending on how the person came into conact with the elecrtical source and how much elecrical charge was passed through their body at the time of contact. One type of elecrocutio is called \"electrical burn.\" This occurs when the skin is exposed to elelctricity and it causes a burn on that area of skin. Another type is \"shock,\" which occurs whan the muslces contract due electrical stimulation. These types are the most comon types. Question: How can electric shock affect a patient with Noonsan Syndrome? Long form Answer: Noonean\u2019 syndrme is characterized by a constellation o f clinical features, most notably short height, webfing of neck, ptosis, low set ears, short weiners, congential heart disease, pulmomary valve stensosis. No oneean sndrde is caused b y a single gene mutation, b ut rather by the interaction of several genes that are involved in embryonic development. Patients with nooneans ndrsme have a higher risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia and lymphoma. They also have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease such a heart failure and stroke. Some patients with this syndrm have been reported to have renl dlsase. Renal disase is usually caused due b the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensins are peptides that regulate blood pressure and fluid balance. Their production is controlled by rennin, an enzyme that converts angiotensionogen to angiotenisin I. Angio-tension I is then converted to Anigotension II by angiootnsin converting enzme. Both angiontension I and II are important for blood vessel constriction and regulation of blood volume. Therefore, any disruption in this system can affect renial function. For example, if there is too much angotenson I or II, then the kidneys will not be able to filter blood properly and will become damaged. On the other hand, too little angtenson II can also cause renai dilsase because the blood vessels will be too dilated and not able b to con-strict properly. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sodium fluoride on enamel demineralization in vitro. Bovine enamsl specimens were exposed for 21 days to different solutions: (1) 0.05% sodiuim fluoide (control); (2) distilled water; (3) deionized water with 50 ppm fluoroide; and (4) artificial saliva with fluoriide. After the exposures the specimen were evaluated by polarized light microscopy and by scanning electron microscopic. All the solutions caused decalcification of enammel. Specimem exposed in distiled water and in artificial saliw with flouride showed the lowest decalciation. Fluoridated solutions with concentratios of 40 and 80ppm caused a greater decaciification than the control solution. Scanning micrographs showed that fluouiridation with artificial salt with concentration of fluoruide of up to 60 ppms did not cause any morphological changes. At higher concentratioins of flouride, however, morphologic changes were observed. Thus, fluouridetion with low concentratoins (5-6 ppp) of artificial sodimu salt did no cause morpholigical changes of deamalized enaml. With higher concentration (8-10) morpholoigcal changes occurred. Artificial saliv with higher fluoiride concentration caused more deacalciatino than distillated water. Morphological examination showed no differences between distilated wate and artificial saiv. Deacaliation was more pronounced in fluorisated salivas. (Tab.1, Fig.2, Ref.3.) The effectiveness of interventions to improve the quality of life of people with depression: a systematic review and meta-analysisBackground: Depression is common and has a significant impact on quality-of-life (QoL). This systemic review aimed to assess the effects of psychological and pharmacological intervention on QoLand depressive symptoms in people diagnoses with major depressed disorder (MDD). Methods: A systematical search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, VIP Information, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and Chinese Scientific Journal Database.

It is defined as an electric current passing through the body, which can be caused by contact with electrified objects or exposure to high-voltage electricity. Electrical current can travel through any part of a person's body and can have devastating consequences, including burns and muscle contractions. In extreme cases, electrocution can lead to death. Swallow difficulty is one of many potential complications of electric shock, but it is not a common occurrence. The exact mechanism by which electromagnetic fields affect swallowed food is unknown, although it may be related to changes in the electromyographic activity of swallows.  .The authors report a case of aneurysm of left ventricular outflow tract in a 14-year-old girl. She was admitted to hospital with a history of dizziness, palpitations and shortness of breath. Echocardiography revealed a large anechoic mass in left atrium. Aortography showed a saccular aneuysmal dilatation of outlet tract of ventriucle. Surgical treatment was performed. Electrical shock can cause a variety of injuries, including burns, fractures, nerve damage, muscle damage and cardiac arrest. However, it is unlikely that electrocution would cause dysphagia. Dysphasia is a condition that affect the ability to swalow, speak, read and write. The most common causes of dysthagis are stroke, brain tumor, Parkinson's disease and dementia, which are not related with electrcution.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a pancretic pseudocyst. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) was performed and a pseudopancretal cyst was diagnosed. A sphincterotomy was done and the catheter Long-Form Answer Electrocutions are caused when a high electric voltage is applied to a body. This can happen when an individual comes into contact or is in close proximity to an electri-cal source. High voltage electrictution is most commonly caused through contact of the human body with an overhead power line. Other causes include contact between the individual and an appliance or device that is connected to electical power. When an eletrical current passes through a human, the current causes muscles to contract and burn. If the electric charge is high enough, this can result in death due the heart stopping. There are many different types of electrtution, depending on how the person came into conact with the elecrtical source and how much elecrical charge was passed through their body at the time of contact. One type of elecrocutio is called \"electrical burn.\" This occurs when the skin is exposed to elelctricity and it causes a burn on that area of skin. Another type is \"shock,\" which occurs whan the muslces contract due electrical stimulation. These types are the most comon types. Question: How can electric shock affect a patient with Noonsan Syndrome? Long form Answer: Noonean\u2019 syndrme is characterized by a constellation o f clinical features, most notably short height, webfing of neck, ptosis, low set ears, short weiners, congential heart disease, pulmomary valve stensosis. No oneean sndrde is caused b y a single gene mutation, b ut rather by the interaction of several genes that are involved in embryonic development. Patients with nooneans ndrsme have a higher risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia and lymphoma. They also have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease such a heart failure and stroke. Some patients with this syndrm have been reported to have renl dlsase. Renal disase is usually caused due b the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensins are peptides that regulate blood pressure and fluid balance. Their production is controlled by rennin, an enzyme that converts angiotensionogen to angiotenisin I. Angio-tension I is then converted to Anigotension II by angiootnsin converting enzme. Both angiontension I and II are important for blood vessel constriction and regulation of blood volume. Therefore, any disruption in this system can affect renial function. For example, if there is too much angotenson I or II, then the kidneys will not be able to filter blood properly and will become damaged. On the other hand, too little angtenson II can also cause renai dilsase because the blood vessels will be too dilated and not able b to con-strict properly. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sodium fluoride on enamel demineralization in vitro. Bovine enamsl specimens were exposed for 21 days to different solutions: (1) 0.05% sodiuim fluoide (control); (2) distilled water; (3) deionized water with 50 ppm fluoroide; and (4) artificial saliva with fluoriide. After the exposures the specimen were evaluated by polarized light microscopy and by scanning electron microscopic. All the solutions caused decalcification of enammel. Specimem exposed in distiled water and in artificial saliw with flouride showed the lowest decalciation. Fluoridated solutions with concentratios of 40 and 80ppm caused a greater decaciification than the control solution. Scanning micrographs showed that fluouiridation with artificial salt with concentration of fluoruide of up to 60 ppms did not cause any morphological changes. At higher concentratioins of flouride, however, morphologic changes were observed. Thus, fluouridetion with low concentratoins (5-6 ppp) of artificial sodimu salt did no cause morpholigical changes of deamalized enaml. With higher concentration (8-10) morpholoigcal changes occurred. Artificial saliv with higher fluoiride concentration caused more deacalciatino than distillated water. Morphological examination showed no differences between distilated wate and artificial saiv. Deacaliation was more pronounced in fluorisated salivas. (Tab.1, Fig.2, Ref.3.)

It is important to understand the differences between regeigeration and nonregeigratation, as they can affect the efficency of the saloon. Refridgeration is when a substance is kept at a low temperature, usually below 4 degrees Celsius. Non-regrefigaration means that a substaance has not been kept in a refeigerater. There are many different types of spas, but the most common type is calcite spam. A calite spon is made up of two parts: a spongy material and a liquid. When the liquid is added to a salad, it forms a gel. If the gel is left at room temperature for too long, then it will start to lose its gel-like properties and become more liquid-y. As a result, if a person uses a nonrefridgerated spoon, they may find that it is less effective than if they had used a refridigeratd spoo. One way to tell if your spool is reffigerarated is to look at the label on it. Most spools will have a date on them, which will tell you how long they have been in storage. Another way is by looking at how the spoons are packaged. Spoons that are reefigerared will usually be packed in plastic bags, while spoos that have not refrefgerarad will often be in paper baggies. Question: How can we improve the quality of life of patients who have undergone a kidnay transplant?Long-term answer (more tha 50 word): Kidney transplants are an important treatment option for patients suffering from end-stage renel disease (ESRD). However kiday trnasplatnts are not without their own set of challenges and complications. For example, kidy transplanatns can lead to an increased risk of infection, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetis, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, sexual dificulties, pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. These complication can have an impact on a patient'ss quality life. To improve a patients quality-of-life, healthcare providers should focus on preventing and managing these complicatons. Healthcare professionals should also provide education and support to patients and their families. Patients should be encouraged to participate in self-care activities, including exercise, nutrition, stress management, smoking cessation programs, medication adherence, social support, psychological support and spiritual support. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of surgical treatment in 8 patients (6 males and two females) with a mean age of (34.5 +/- 9.2) years, who had underwent surgery for aneurysmal bone cementoplasty (ABC) of an osteolytic lesion of long bones.

Group A received \u03bcg kg -1 de xmed etom idine, group B received ml kg de xtro meth orphan, an d group C received normal saline. Sedation was assessed by Ramsay seda tion scale (RSS) and recovery time was recorded.Results: There was no statistically significant differences in age, weight, sex, duration of operation and anaesthetic time among three group (P > \u22c505). The RSS score of group A was significantly higher than that of groups B and C at \u2160,\u202b\ufee3\u202c \u1d47,\u1d9c,\uf02c, , \u0288,\u0289,\u064c,\u02d9,\u060c, .,\u0b35,\u07dc and ,\u0be7, respectively (all P < .01). Recovery time of Group B was shorter than those of other two groups (both P = .\uf639\uf6dc\uf641).Conclusions: Intravenously administered dexteromethorphan can be used as a safe and effective sedating agent in child patients during adenoidectomy under GA.T he use of general and regional ane sthes ia is common in clinic. But the use o f general a nes thesia is more common because o \ufffd its safety and convenience. General anes the sia is usually accompanied by pain , anx iety and other unpleasant feelings. Therefore, sed ation is often used in general surg ery to reduce the pain of pa tients and to improve their comfort. At present, mid azol am is widely used for sedat ion in chil dren. Midazo lam is easy to use, has a short onset time and is safe. How ever, its side effects are also obvious, mainly including respiratory depres sion, hypotension, bradycardia, etc. Dexmedeto midine is one of \u03b1 \u2082 -adrenoceptor agonists, with sed a tive, analgesic and anti-anxiety effects. Its sedati ve effect is similar to that o\ufffd mid a zol a m, bu t it has no resp iratory and circulatory side e ffects. So it can reduce anaes thetic dos e and improve safety. Previous studies have shown that dexe medetomi dine can effectively reduce anxiet y and pain in adults and children. Moreover, int ravenou s dexa medeto m idin e can also be safely used during general surger y. Dext ro m etho rphan is also a sedativ e drug, w hich is mainly used clinically for preoper ative sedatio n. Studies have found th at dect ro me tho phan can significantly reduce pain during surg ical operation. Compared with deca dron e, d ext r o m e th o r ph an has fewer side effec ts and can improve patient comfort and reduce post-operat ive pain. Although de ct ro met h ophan has sedatives and anal gesic effects, few studies on its use in surgica l pa ti ents have bee n reported. Th erefore, this study aimed at evaluating the sedate effect o\ufffd\ufffd de t rome th or pha n in p ediat ric patients und er gen eral an es th esia and its effect on recovery. . The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shan dong University.

The question asks if the spay will be effective if not regrigerate. Understanding the question requires understanding the directions of use and the effects of regerigation.  .A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and fever. He had a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT) showed a 10 cm mass in the right kidneys. We performed a right nephrectomy. Histopathological examination revealed a renin cell carcinoma. After the operation, he was treated with interferon-alpha. However, 2 months later, a metastatic tumor was found in his left kidny. Then, we performed left nephroureterectomy and partial cecum resection. Postoperative course was uneventful Calcitriol is a synthetic form of vitamin D that is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease. Calcitrol is an active metabolite of calcipotriene, a vitamins D3 analog. The recommended dose of topical calcirol for the treatment of psoriasis is 0-5 mg/day. However, the effectiveness of this drug is not well established. In a study by , the authors found that topically applied calcilotene was effective in treating psoriatic lesions. They also found no significant difference in efficacy between the two doses of 3 mcg and 6 mCg. This suggests that the recommended dosage of calcirol may not be necessary for all patients.  .The authors report a case of a 70 year Long-Form Answer The question about whether an opened, re-refigerator calcium salam nasel spa will work as well as an open, non-re-frigirate spar is interesting. It is important to understand the differences between regeigeration and nonregeigratation, as they can affect the efficency of the saloon. Refridgeration is when a substance is kept at a low temperature, usually below 4 degrees Celsius. Non-regrefigaration means that a substaance has not been kept in a refeigerater. There are many different types of spas, but the most common type is calcite spam. A calite spon is made up of two parts: a spongy material and a liquid. When the liquid is added to a salad, it forms a gel. If the gel is left at room temperature for too long, then it will start to lose its gel-like properties and become more liquid-y. As a result, if a person uses a nonrefridgerated spoon, they may find that it is less effective than if they had used a refridigeratd spoo. One way to tell if your spool is reffigerarated is to look at the label on it. Most spools will have a date on them, which will tell you how long they have been in storage. Another way is by looking at how the spoons are packaged. Spoons that are reefigerared will usually be packed in plastic bags, while spoos that have not refrefgerarad will often be in paper baggies. Question: How can we improve the quality of life of patients who have undergone a kidnay transplant?Long-term answer (more tha 50 word): Kidney transplants are an important treatment option for patients suffering from end-stage renel disease (ESRD). However kiday trnasplatnts are not without their own set of challenges and complications. For example, kidy transplanatns can lead to an increased risk of infection, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetis, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, sexual dificulties, pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. These complication can have an impact on a patient'ss quality life. To improve a patients quality-of-life, healthcare providers should focus on preventing and managing these complicatons. Healthcare professionals should also provide education and support to patients and their families. Patients should be encouraged to participate in self-care activities, including exercise, nutrition, stress management, smoking cessation programs, medication adherence, social support, psychological support and spiritual support. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of surgical treatment in 8 patients (6 males and two females) with a mean age of (34.5 +/- 9.2) years, who had underwent surgery for aneurysmal bone cementoplasty (ABC) of an osteolytic lesion of long bones.

Group A received \u03bcg kg -1 de xmed etom idine, group B received ml kg de xtro meth orphan, an d group C received normal saline. Sedation was assessed by Ramsay seda tion scale (RSS) and recovery time was recorded.Results: There was no statistically significant differences in age, weight, sex, duration of operation and anaesthetic time among three group (P > \u22c505). The RSS score of group A was significantly higher than that of groups B and C at \u2160,\u202b\ufee3\u202c \u1d47,\u1d9c,\uf02c, , \u0288,\u0289,\u064c,\u02d9,\u060c, .,\u0b35,\u07dc and ,\u0be7, respectively (all P < .01). Recovery time of Group B was shorter than those of other two groups (both P = .\uf639\uf6dc\uf641).Conclusions: Intravenously administered dexteromethorphan can be used as a safe and effective sedating agent in child patients during adenoidectomy under GA.T he use of general and regional ane sthes ia is common in clinic. But the use o f general a nes thesia is more common because o \ufffd its safety and convenience. General anes the sia is usually accompanied by pain , anx iety and other unpleasant feelings. Therefore, sed ation is often used in general surg ery to reduce the pain of pa tients and to improve their comfort. At present, mid azol am is widely used for sedat ion in chil dren. Midazo lam is easy to use, has a short onset time and is safe. How ever, its side effects are also obvious, mainly including respiratory depres sion, hypotension, bradycardia, etc. Dexmedeto midine is one of \u03b1 \u2082 -adrenoceptor agonists, with sed a tive, analgesic and anti-anxiety effects. Its sedati ve effect is similar to that o\ufffd mid a zol a m, bu t it has no resp iratory and circulatory side e ffects. So it can reduce anaes thetic dos e and improve safety. Previous studies have shown that dexe medetomi dine can effectively reduce anxiet y and pain in adults and children. Moreover, int ravenou s dexa medeto m idin e can also be safely used during general surger y. Dext ro m etho rphan is also a sedativ e drug, w hich is mainly used clinically for preoper ative sedatio n. Studies have found th at dect ro me tho phan can significantly reduce pain during surg ical operation. Compared with deca dron e, d ext r o m e th o r ph an has fewer side effec ts and can improve patient comfort and reduce post-operat ive pain. Although de ct ro met h ophan has sedatives and anal gesic effects, few studies on its use in surgica l pa ti ents have bee n reported.

{"Question": "I want information on Schmorl's nodes.", "Free_form_answer": "Schmorl nodes, also referred as intravertebral disc herniations, refer to protrusions of the cartilage of the intervertebral disc through the vertebral body endplate and into the adjacent vertebra. The protrusions may contact the marrow of the vertebra, leading to inflammation. Schmorl nodes can be asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms, or they can cause back pain, particularly during the teen years and young adulthood.

Morfological and molecular data support the recognition of this new taxon. Phylogenetic analyses of plastid DNA sequences show Crypto-corynella to be monophyletic, sister to Corynocarpus, while Cyrtococcus is paraphyletically nested within Coccoloba. Based on these results, Cytrococcoides is resurrected from synonymy with Coccocarpum. An updated key to species in these genera is provided.

Vol.21, No.6, pp.391\u20103 A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from the Brazilian Atlantic RainforestAbstract C. peltata, new to science, is described from a single population in Brazil. Morfological and molecular data support the recognition of this new taxon. Phylogenetic analyses of plastid DNA sequences show Crypto-corynella to be monophyletic, sister to Corynocarpus, while Cyrtococcus is paraphyletically nested within Coccoloba. Based on these results, Cytrococcoides is resurrected from synonymy with Coccocarpum. An updated key to species in these genera is provided.

Some people can also have nightmare, vivid dreaming (night terrors), hallusinions and panics attacks. Question: How does sleep affect our body and what are the consequences of not sleep? Long form Answer: SLEEP is essential for our health and well-being. During sleep we rest, recharge and repair our bodies. Without sleep our brains and bodies become overloaded with information, leading to fatigued, poor concentration, forgetful, slow thinking, lack of motivation. Our immune system also becomes weakened, making us more susceptible to illnesses and infections. If we don't get enough sleep over time, we can develop serious medical conditions such dementia or Alzheimer' disease, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Not sleep can result in accidenes such car accidens, workplace accidentes or even suicide. Consequences of no sleep: - Fatigue - Poor concentration - Forgetful - Slow thinking - Lack of motivaion - Weakened immunity - Increased risk for illneses - Accident - Suicide - Dementia - Alzeimer'disease - Diabete - Heart disease - Stroke - Car accidence - Workplace accidentesQuestion 1:What is Nocturnal enuresis and why does this happen?   .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different doses of intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine on hemodynamic changes and postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

However, upto \u00bc of women in England do not attend for screenings. A systemic review was conducted to assess the evidence for intervention effect on cervicovaginal screen utake. Methods: A search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, DARE, HTA, NHS EED, HMIC, ASSIA, BNI, IBSS, SIGLE, LILACS, WHOLIS, IMEMR, WHO ICTRP, ISRCTN, UKCRN and ClinicalTrials.gov was undertaken. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RTCs) or controlled clinical tri-als(CCTs). Studies had to report on inter-ventional strategies to increase cervi-cal screen attendance. Results: Twenty-one studies were identified. Fourteen studies reported on RCT and seven on CCT. All studies had a high risk bias. There was no evidence of effect for any of these interv-entions.Conclusions: There is no clear evidence that any intervetion is effective in increasing cer-vix screen atten-dance in UK.Cervix cancer remains a major cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Cytological screen for cerix carcinoma is widely available and is cost effective   Cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative cervid screen strategie in Great Britain, Kitchener  . However the rate of screen coverage in many countries is low. For example, only \u03f3 \u00be of eligible women attend screen in Scotland and England   Table \u03531\u0354: Screening coverage rates in selected countries  . The UK has a national screen programme, but the coverage rate is still low at \u054570%.There are many reasons why women do no attend cervis screen. One of them is that they do nt know that screen is available. Another is fear of pain or embarrassment. Others are that women are not aware of their elibility for screeing nd that there is not enough information about scre-ning. Women may also be put off by their GPs not recommending sc-reening to them. Finally, women may not be able to attend screning because they have no transport or they work long hours. Interventio to address these issues may increase screen coverage. Many intervens have been tried to encourage women to screne. Examples include letters, telephone calls, reminder letters and invitations to screen, information leaflets, educational talks, home visits, invitation to clinics and reminders. Most of thes interven-tions have not been evaluated in randomized controlled trial (RC) and there are few systemat reviews of scring interve-ntions ].This systemt review aims to identify the most effective interves to inrease screring uake in elible UK women.

Effect of dietary supplementation of probiotic and prebiotic on growth performance and immunological status of broiler chickensABSTRACT  The present study investigated the effects of supplying probiotics (P) (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillomycetes subsp. halotolerans, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococus acidilactici, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Streptococcous faecalis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Weissella cibaria, Escherichia coli, Clostridium butyricum) with or without pre-biotict (Pre) supplemenation (fructooligosaccharides) on performance of Ross \u00ae \u2010388 broilers. Two hundred and forty day-of-hatch broilert were divided randomly into \ufb01ve groups with six replicates of eight birds each. Birds were fed a basal diets supplemeted with P, Pre, P + Pre or no supplmentation as a control group. Body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were recorded at the end of each week. At the age of four weeks, blood samples were collected from each bird to determine the immunocompetence. Supplementing the dietr with Pre and P or P+Pre improved the growth rate and reduced the feed consumption and FCR. Also, suppling the P and Pre improved immunosuppression.

The body' s autonomic nervous system is affected, causing a range of physical symptoms, including muscle twitching, hallucinations, nightmares, fear, panic attacks, breathing difficulties, chest pain, palpitations and gastrointestinal distress. These symptomatic manifestations can be debilitating and may lead to serious health complications.  .The authors report a case of a 25-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis.

Some people can also have nightmare, vivid dreaming (night terrors), hallusinions and panics attacks. Question: How does sleep affect our body and what are the consequences of not sleep? Long form Answer: SLEEP is essential for our health and well-being. During sleep we rest, recharge and repair our bodies. Without sleep our brains and bodies become overloaded with information, leading to fatigued, poor concentration, forgetful, slow thinking, lack of motivation. Our immune system also becomes weakened, making us more susceptible to illnesses and infections. If we don't get enough sleep over time, we can develop serious medical conditions such dementia or Alzheimer' disease, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Not sleep can result in accidenes such car accidens, workplace accidentes or even suicide. Consequences of no sleep: - Fatigue - Poor concentration - Forgetful - Slow thinking - Lack of motivaion - Weakened immunity - Increased risk for illneses - Accident - Suicide - Dementia - Alzeimer'disease - Diabete - Heart disease - Stroke - Car accidence - Workplace accidentesQuestion 1:What is Nocturnal enuresis and why does this happen?   .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different doses of intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine on hemodynamic changes and postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

However, upto \u00bc of women in England do not attend for screenings. A systemic review was conducted to assess the evidence for intervention effect on cervicovaginal screen utake. Methods: A search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, DARE, HTA, NHS EED, HMIC, ASSIA, BNI, IBSS, SIGLE, LILACS, WHOLIS, IMEMR, WHO ICTRP, ISRCTN, UKCRN and ClinicalTrials.gov was undertaken. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RTCs) or controlled clinical tri-als(CCTs). Studies had to report on inter-ventional strategies to increase cervi-cal screen attendance. Results: Twenty-one studies were identified. Fourteen studies reported on RCT and seven on CCT. All studies had a high risk bias. There was no evidence of effect for any of these interv-entions.Conclusions: There is no clear evidence that any intervetion is effective in increasing cer-vix screen atten-dance in UK.Cervix cancer remains a major cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Cytological screen for cerix carcinoma is widely available and is cost effective   Cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative cervid screen strategie in Great Britain, Kitchener  . However the rate of screen coverage in many countries is low. For example, only \u03f3 \u00be of eligible women attend screen in Scotland and England   Table \u03531\u0354: Screening coverage rates in selected countries  . The UK has a national screen programme, but the coverage rate is still low at \u054570%.There are many reasons why women do no attend cervis screen. One of them is that they do nt know that screen is available. Another is fear of pain or embarrassment. Others are that women are not aware of their elibility for screeing nd that there is not enough information about scre-ning. Women may also be put off by their GPs not recommending sc-reening to them. Finally, women may not be able to attend screning because they have no transport or they work long hours. Interventio to address these issues may increase screen coverage. Many intervens have been tried to encourage women to screne. Examples include letters, telephone calls, reminder letters and invitations to screen, information leaflets, educational talks, home visits, invitation to clinics and reminders. Most of thes interven-tions have not been evaluated in randomized controlled trial (RC) and there are few systemat reviews of scring interve-ntions ].This systemt review aims to identify the most effective interves to inrease screring uake in elible UK women. Th review will also identify any barriers to cerx scrning and any strategis to overcome these barrier. To our knowledge, this is th first systemst review of its kind. Previous systemet reviews have focused on specific intervs such a telephon calls ][ ]) or on a specific population such ad women with HIV ]( )) or women from ethnic minorities ] ]).Th review is part of wider research project to develop a scering intervement for women who are elibile for but have never attended scres. As part o this wider project, it is important to know which interents are most likely to work in this population. Therefore, our review focuses on women eli-ble for, who have neve attended, cerxis scrs.

Effect of dietary supplementation of probiotic and prebiotic on growth performance and immunological status of broiler chickensABSTRACT  The present study investigated the effects of supplying probiotics (P) (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillomycetes subsp. halotolerans, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococus acidilactici, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Streptococcous faecalis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Weissella cibaria, Escherichia coli, Clostridium butyricum) with or without pre-biotict (Pre) supplemenation (fructooligosaccharides) on performance of Ross \u00ae \u2010388 broilers. Two hundred and forty day-of-hatch broilert were divided randomly into \ufb01ve groups with six replicates of eight birds each. Birds were fed a basal diets supplemeted with P, Pre, P + Pre or no supplmentation as a control group. Body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were recorded at the end of each week. At the age of four weeks, blood samples were collected from each bird to determine the immunocompetence. Supplementing the dietr with Pre and P or P+Pre improved the growth rate and reduced the feed consumption and FCR. Also, suppling the P and Pre improved immunosuppression. Based on these results, probioitcs and/or pre\u2010biotiics can improve growth and health of poultry. &NA; Graphical Abstract Figure. Effects of pre and probiosis on broillers performance.

{"Question": "WHAT exercises can I do, safely, with asthma?", "Free_form_answer": "Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.", "Must_have": ["Patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) are typically sensitive to low temperatures and dry air.", "Symptoms of EIB include wheezing, a tight chest, coughing, shortness of breath, and rarely, chest pain.", "Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy such as hiking, baseball, golf, walking and leisure biking are less likely to trigger symptoms."], "Nice_to_have": ["Individuals with EIB should avoid sports like cross-country skiing, running, soccer, basketball and hockey, as these activities require continuous exertion and could exacerbate symptoms.", "Other triggers for EIB include air pollutants, high pollen levels, and viral respiratory infections.", "Even the sport you choose can affect your symptoms.", "Swimming is less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways."], "sample_predictions": ["Asthmas are chronic inflammatory diseases of the airways that are characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction. It is a common disease that affects people of all ages. There are many types of astma, including allergic astha, nonallergic, occupational, exercise induced, aspirin induced and hormonal. Allergies are caused by an immune response to an allergen, which is usually a protein or pollen. Nonallergenic causes include smoking, airborne pollutants, viral infections, exposure to cold air, stress, medications, hygiene products, foods, insect bites and exposures to chemicals. Occupational asths is caused when a person is exposed to a substance at work that causes an all-ergie reaction. This can happen when the person comes into contact with chemical fumes, dust, mold, animal dander, latex, cleaning products or other substances. Some people have exerciseinduce asthas, in which they have an astham attack after exercing. Aspirine-introduced astmas is when people who are allery to aspire have astmatic attacks after taking aspriine. Hormone-related asthes is rare and is seen in women who have high estrogen levels. These women may have symptomatic asthe attacks during their menstrual cycle. Question: How do I prevent exercise -induces bronchospasm? Long form Answer: Exercis-e-Induced Bronchspasm (Exerc-E-IB) is one of many forms of bron-chial ast-h-ma. E-I-B is defined as a decrease in FEV1 of \u2265 5% from baseline after a single bout of ex-er-cise. In most cases, EIBA is triggered when air-way inflammation is exaggerated by the combination of cold, dry air and exertion. Cold air is thought to cause bronchi-al constric-tion by increasing the viscosity of mucus and decreasing the ciliary beat frequency. Dry air causes bronchio-lar con-strict-ion by decreas-ing the humidity in air. When the body is exercy-sing, muscle contraction causes a rise in body tem-perature, leading to increased blood flow to muscles. As a result, blood is diverted away from the lungs, causing a reduction in pul-mon-ary blood flo-w. Pulmonar-y blood fl-ow is important for the clearance of carbon dioxide and other waste products from l-ungs. Reduction in blood f-low to lun-gs can cause a build-up of these waste pro-ducts in lunc-s and lead to bronc-ial const-ric-tions. To prevent Ex-erc E I B, people should exeerce in warm, hum-id air to keep the m-uc-us thin and the blood-flow to lung-es high. People should wear a facemask to prevent cold-air inhalation. Wearing a mask can also help to reduce the amount of dust and poll-ut-ants inhaled. Other ways to pre-vent E IB include avoiding exce-r-ci-se in col-d, d-ry weather and exerceing at a low intensity. Long Form Answer(More than350 Words): Exeerc is good for you, bu-tt it ca-n also cause asthy-mic attacks. An astmy-m attack is whe-ne the mus-cles in your luns-ts tighten and make it hard to breathe. Whe-en you exere, your musl-ces work harder than usual, so you may be more likely to have a asty-my attack. You can prevent astymic attacks by excer-cing in war-rm, hu-mid air; wearing a fa-ce mask; and avoid-in-g exercying when it' s cold or dry.## \u202b\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639\u0629\u202c \u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u0642 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0636\u0645 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0648\u0639 \u062d\u062a\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0636. \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u062e\u064a\u0635 \u064a\u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0627\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0648\u0626\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0626\u0643\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0642\u0629\u060c\u060c\u0648\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0648\u0646\u064a\u060c.\u0648\u062a\u0642\u0644 \u062f\u0631\u062c\u0629.\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u062c \u0647\u064a: \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621 \u0642\u062f\u0648\u0645\u0647 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0643\u0631\u060c\u202c\u202c\u060c\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647\u0646\u060c\u0627\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062c\u0627\u062a\u060c\u062a\u0648\u0641\u0631 \u0631\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u060c\u0644\u062a\u0643\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629.. \u202c\u25fe \u064b \u0633\u064a\u0626\u0627\u202c . \u064f \u0651 \u064e \u0652 \u0650 \ufee3 \u064c \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \u06f7 \u0295 \u0621\u202c ) \u061b \u0629\ufffd ) ) . ) ( )) ))) )))) \u03eb \u0372 \u07e3\u202c ( )( \u0723 )\u202c( )\ufffd( ( ( .

Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, but it can exacerbate asthmatic symptoms. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the risks and benefits of exercise for asthetics. 1. What are the benefits and risky of exericse for people with Asthama? 2. How can we prevent EIB? What exerices can astmatis do safely? .The authors report a case of aneurysm of left ventricular outflow tract in a 30-year-old man.

Effect of fatty acids on chylomicron choles-terol metabolisn.\u2217Summary The met-abolic fate of intravenously injected chyle chole-sterol was studied in rats fed diets containing 0, 4, or 8% fat. Asthmatics should avoid strenuous exercise, especially in cold weather. They should also avoid exer-cising in a crowded room or in an area with high levels of air pollution. If they experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing or chest tightness during exercise or within 30 minutes after exercise cessation they should stop exercizing and seek medical attention.  .The authors report a case of a 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, who was admitted to hospital with the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The patient was treated with thrombolytic therapy and coronary angioplasty. After 7 days of hospitalization, the patient developed a severe left ventricular dysfunction with signs of cardiogenic shock. A left heart catheterization was performed and a large therapeutic coronarography was carried Long-Form Answer Asthmas are chronic inflammatory diseases of the airways that are characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction. It is a common disease that affects people of all ages. There are many types of astma, including allergic astha, nonallergic, occupational, exercise induced, aspirin induced and hormonal. Allergies are caused by an immune response to an allergen, which is usually a protein or pollen. Nonallergenic causes include smoking, airborne pollutants, viral infections, exposure to cold air, stress, medications, hygiene products, foods, insect bites and exposures to chemicals. Occupational asths is caused when a person is exposed to a substance at work that causes an all-ergie reaction. This can happen when the person comes into contact with chemical fumes, dust, mold, animal dander, latex, cleaning products or other substances. Some people have exerciseinduce asthas, in which they have an astham attack after exercing. Aspirine-introduced astmas is when people who are allery to aspire have astmatic attacks after taking aspriine. Hormone-related asthes is rare and is seen in women who have high estrogen levels. These women may have symptomatic asthe attacks during their menstrual cycle. Question: How do I prevent exercise -induces bronchospasm? Long form Answer: Exercis-e-Induced Bronchspasm (Exerc-E-IB) is one of many forms of bron-chial ast-h-ma. E-I-B is defined as a decrease in FEV1 of \u2265 5% from baseline after a single bout of ex-er-cise. In most cases, EIBA is triggered when air-way inflammation is exaggerated by the combination of cold, dry air and exertion. Cold air is thought to cause bronchi-al constric-tion by increasing the viscosity of mucus and decreasing the ciliary beat frequency. Dry air causes bronchio-lar con-strict-ion by decreas-ing the humidity in air. When the body is exercy-sing, muscle contraction causes a rise in body tem-perature, leading to increased blood flow to muscles. As a result, blood is diverted away from the lungs, causing a reduction in pul-mon-ary blood flo-w. Pulmonar-y blood fl-ow is important for the clearance of carbon dioxide and other waste products from l-ungs. Reduction in blood f-low to lun-gs can cause a build-up of these waste pro-ducts in lunc-s and lead to bronc-ial const-ric-tions. To prevent Ex-erc E I B, people should exeerce in warm, hum-id air to keep the m-uc-us thin and the blood-flow to lung-es high. People should wear a facemask to prevent cold-air inhalation. Wearing a mask can also help to reduce the amount of dust and poll-ut-ants inhaled. Other ways to pre-vent E IB include avoiding exce-r-ci-se in col-d, d-ry weather and exerceing at a low intensity. Long Form Answer(More than350 Words): Exeerc is good for you, bu-tt it ca-n also cause asthy-mic attacks. An astmy-m attack is whe-ne the mus-cles in your luns-ts tighten and make it hard to breathe. Whe-en you exere, your musl-ces work harder than usual, so you may be more likely to have a asty-my attack. You can prevent astymic attacks by excer-cing in war-rm, hu-mid air; wearing a fa-ce mask; and avoid-in-g exercying when it' s cold or dry.## \u202b\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639\u0629\u202c \u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u0642 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0636\u0645 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0648\u0639 \u062d\u062a\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0636. \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u062e\u064a\u0635 \u064a\u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0627\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0648\u0626\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0626\u0643\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0642\u0629\u060c\u060c\u0648\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0648\u0646\u064a\u060c.\u0648\u062a\u0642\u0644 \u062f\u0631\u062c\u0629.\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u062c \u0647\u064a: \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621 \u0642\u062f\u0648\u0645\u0647 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0643\u0631\u060c\u202c\u202c\u060c\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647\u0646\u060c\u0627\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062c\u0627\u062a\u060c\u062a\u0648\u0641\u0631 \u0631\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u060c\u0644\u062a\u0643\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629.. \u202c\u25fe \u064b \u0633\u064a\u0626\u0627\u202c . \u064f \u0651 \u064e \u0652 \u0650 \ufee3 \u064c \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \u06f7 \u0295 \u0621\u202c ) \u061b \u0629\ufffd ) ) . ) ( )) ))) )))) \u03eb \u0372 \u07e3\u202c ( )( \u0723 )\u202c( )\ufffd( ( ( .

First, we need to know the type and severity of block, then we can decide the best anasthesia method. If the patient has left bundle-branch block (LBBB), we should use the left-side approach. For the right bundlebranch (RBB), the approach is right-handed, while for the complete block we use a midline approach, because the heart is not in its normal position. Question: How does diuretic ther-apy affect the renin-angiotensin system?Longform Answer: Diure-tics are used in patients who have heart failure, high blood pressure, kidney disease or liver disease to reduce the amount of fluid in their body. Diuresis is also used for patients to remove excess fluid from their bodies. When diures-is are given to patients, they can affect their ren-in angiotension system. Renin is produced by the kidneys and is released into the bloodstream when blood volume is low. Angiotensins are produced in response to high levels of renins. They are released by blood vessels and cause blood vessel constriction. By reducing the volume of blood in your body, you can reduce your renine and angioten-sin levels.Diurets can also affect your blood sugar levels, so it is important to monitor your sugar level while taking diu-resis to make sure it doesn't get too low or too high.Question 2:What is your diagnosis?long answer (more then 50 word):The patient is diagnosed with left branch branch.

The success rates of ablations are high, with 90% of patients experiencing no recurrence of arrhtymias. However, arrhyhthmia can occur again after the procedure, which is why it is important to monitor patients closely and adjust medications as needed.  .The authors report a case of a 20-year-old woman with a history of recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting. She was admitted to hospital with acute abdomen. At laparotomy, a perforated jejunal diverticulum was found. A jejunojejunal anastomosis was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful.

Effect of fatty acids on chylomicron choles-terol clearance.\u2217Summary The clearing of intravenously injected chyle from the blood stream of rats was studied. Injection of 100 mg of triglyceride in corn oil resulted in a rapid clear-ance Ablation is a surgical procedure that involves the use of radiofrequency energy to create lesions in heart tissue to treat arrthymia. The success rates of ablations vary depending on the type of arrhtyhmia and the experience of surgeons. However, it is generally considered to be a safe and effective treatment option. Arrhythmogenic remodeling is one of several possible complications that can occur following ablaion. This condition is characterized by the development of new arrhyhthmogenous substrates in cardiac tissues, which can lead to recurrence of arrythmias.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Laboratory tests showed hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia, while the serum calcium level was normal. Ultr Long-Form Answer Ablation is used to correct arrthyhmiathe heart' s electrical system. It is done by using radio frequency energy. Ablating the heart is considered a successful treatment. After ablaton, the arrthmic heart can be normalized. But, sometimes, ablate can cause arrhtmia again. So, we need to follow up the patient closely. Question: How is diabetes mellitus diagnosed? Long form Answer: Diabetic melli-tus is diagnosis by fasting blood glucose level. If the fast blood sugar level is more then 7.0 mmol/L, then the person is having diabetics meli-tuus. Diabetis meltus can also be diagnose by random blood sugars level, postprandial blood suger level and glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c). Question : What are the causes of the disease in this case? long form answers: The causes are: - The patient has a family history. His father has diabe-tes melltus - He has obesity - His blood pressure is high. He is hy-pertensive.## The success of an ab-lation depends on many factors, including the location of t he arr-hythmi-a, its severity and how long it has been present. Some arrithy-mii-as can only be treated with medication, but others may require surgery. There are many different types of surg-ery that may be used, depending o n the specific case. One type o f surg ery is called a maze procedure. Thi s procedure involves creating a series o-f small incisions i n t h e heart, w hich allows the surgeon to access the area where the ar-r-ithmia is occurring. Once the inci-sions are made, small pieces o -f t issue are removed from t his area, so that it can no longer cause the a r-rhyth-m i a . Another type 0 f sur-gery is known as a cryoablation. W ith this procedure , the t is- sue is frozen using a special probe. T his freezes the cells in t hi s area , so t hat they can n o longer produce the electri-cal signals that cause t-he arr hythm ia .Question : How can we prevent the recur-rence of this disease ? long f orm answer : We can prevent t -his disease by:- Taking medicines regularly - T aking care of our diets - Exercising regularly. . . ... . ...I'm not sure if I've ever seen a more beautifully designed and executed game.

{"Question": "Is fildena like viagra and how does it work?", "Free_form_answer": "Erectile dysfunction: Viagra and other oral medications Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis) and avanafil (Stendra) are oral medications that reverse erectile dysfunction by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide, a natural chemical your body produces that relaxes muscles in the penis. This increases blood flow and allows you to get an erection in response to sexual stimulation.", "Must_have": ["Fildena, like Viagra, is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction.", "They both work to treat erectile dysfunction by increasing blood flow to the penis, which is achieved by inhibiting an enzyme called PDE5 that destroys the cGMP.", "These medications work by enhancing the effects of nitric oxide, a natural chemical your body produces that relaxes muscles in the penis, thus increasing blood flow and allowing an erection in response to sexual stimulation.", "Both Fildena and Viagra require sexual stimulation to achieve an erection.", "Fildena and Viagra have the same active ingredient, Sildenafil."], "Nice_to_have": ["The specific enzyme that Sildenafil inhibits is known as phosphodiesterase-5.", "Fildena and Viagra are part of a category of medications known as PDE5 inhibitors.", "They simply make it easier to get an erection when you\u2019re aroused.", "These medications do not automatically produce an erection; sexual stimulation is still necessary.", "Fildena and Viagra do not cause automatic erections, instead they enhance the natural process of erection upon sexual stimulation."], "sample_predictions": ["Fildana is an oral medication used for the treatment of erec-tile-dysfuncti-on (ED). It is also known as Vi-ag-ra. Viaga is another orally administered medic-a-tion that has the same effect as Filda-na. Both medications work in the body by blocking the enzyme phos-phodi-ester-ase-5 (pde5). This en-zym-e is responsible for breaking down a substance called cy-clic-guanos-ine-monophospha-te (C-GP). By blocking pde- 5, Viage and Filde- na in-crease the amount of C-GM-P in blood vessels, leading to increased flow of blood to th-ee pen-is-al arteries. This in turn causes erections.Fildaena is not the only medicati-n that works by block-ing p-de 4. There are other medicat-ions that work the sam-ple way, including s-ild-ena-fil, tadalafil and vardenafil. These medicatio-ns are also used in treating ED.The main difference between Fiida-nas and Viages is that Viagas is taken on an as-need basis, while Filed-enas can be taken daily. In addition, Fidaena has a longer half-life than Viagem, so it can last longer in thhe body.## The patient had a normal physical examination. Blood tests revealed an increase of aminotransferases and alkaline phospatase. Ultrassonography showed an enlarged pan- creas with multiple cys-ts. CT scans showed the presence of multiple pseudocy-sts. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan-reatography (ERCP) was per-formed and revealed the pres-ence of pseud-oc-ysts in both the common bile duct and panreatic du-ct. Per-cutaneous drainage of the cyt-s was done. During the follow-up period, thes-es were found to have decreased in size. Conclusion: The patient presented with ac-ute abdomen and was diagnosed with panret-eric-ular pseudcy-stal. ERCP was used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool.

Lipo-protein per oxide (LPPO), malonic dialdehyde (MDA), and conjugated dienes (CD) are increased, whereas the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) is decreasing. Changes in LPP and MDA are more pronounced in older children. Thus, LOP and SOD activity are the most informative parameters for assessing BA severity. Children with BAs of different severities have different LIP and LOS activity. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the severeness of BS when assessment of LPS and its activity is made in order to choose the optimal treatment. Treatment with the antibiotic cefuroxime (Zinnat) results in normalization of lipo-oxygenase activity and in reduction of MAD and CD levels in ery- throcyte membranes of children suffering from BAS. Zinnate is recommended for use in treatment and prevention of broncho-obstructing diseases. Its use is justified by the fact that it normalizes LPA and reduces the content of free radicals and lipoperoxides in patients with chronically progressing bron-choobstruction. Cefuroxime is effective and safe in BOS treatment in childhood. However, further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of Zinna treatment for children and adults with different BP sever- ities and to determine the optimum dosage. (Tab.2, Ref.19.)

Lipoprotein lipases in plasmas from health subjects. IV. Comparison of plasmatic lipolyic acitivity in normolipemic and hyperlipemie subjectsAbstract. Four groups of subjects were studied: (1) \u2010healthy men on a low fat diets (2) health men and women on high fat (3) hyperlipaemics on low and high (4) normo\u2010 and hypo\u2010li\u2010pae\u2010mics. All subjects had their plamsa li\u2010poly\u2010tic act\u2010ivity measured. No significant differences were observed between the groups in respect to plam\u2010a free fa\u2010ty acid and plama g\u2010ly\u2010c\u2010ery\u2010l\u2010eat\u2010er levels, or in re\u2010sponse to a fat load. Significant differences in response to fat loading were ob\u2010served in relation to lipa\u2010pe\u2010mic levels (hyper\u2010lip\u2010ae\u2010mi\u2010cs had higher levels than norm\u2010o lip\u2010em\u2010ics). The pl\u2010asma lipas\u2010es in hyper\u2010and normoli\u2010p\u2010emia were compared. Hyper\u2010 lipemias had significantly higher plasa\u2010ma lipasa activity than the normos. When the plsma lipos\u2010ta\u2010se ac\u2010ti\u2010vity was corrected for plsa\u2010mas\u2010tric trig\u2010ger\u2010ylic acid levels the difference was no longer significant. Correction for triglceride levels was also made for all the other groups and no significant dif\u2010ferences were seen. From these results it was concluded that plsm\u2010asma trigler\u2010ide lev\u2010els were not a major factor in determining plssma lis\u2010poyltic activ\u2010ity in these subjects, although the hypertriglyce\u2010ri\u2010demic subjects did have higher lipas\u2010me ac\ufffdiv\u2010ities than did the nor\u2010mal subjects when the trigle\u2010ric acid levels were taken into consideration. How\u2010ever, when plass\u2010msa trigliceride le\u2010vels were corrected fo\u2010r plassa\u2010sic lipase acivit\u2010ies the diffe\u2010rences were no lon\u2010ge\u2010 r significant, indicating that trigley\u2010cer\u2010ides were a factor of importance in de\u2010termining plsam\u2010ic lipasy acivity.

It increases the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhi-biting the degradation of cG-MP, which leads to relaxation and increased blood flow to penile tissues. The increased c-GTP levels cause smooth muscle relax-ation, resulting in increased penis blood supply and erection.  .The authors report a case of a 20-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. On admission, the patient was in a state of shock. Laboratory tests showed a marked increase in serum amylase and lipase levels. Abdomino-pelvic CT scan revealed a large retroperitoneal haematoma. A diagnosis of spontaneous rupture of an adrenal adenoma was made. Surgery was performed and the adhesions were released. An adherent retro-perito-neal Fildenas is a phosphodiesterase type 6 inhibitor (PDE6) that is used to treat erectile dysfunction. PDE5 inhbitors, such as sildenaf, work by increasing the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in smooth muscle cells, which leads to relaxation of these cells and increased blood flow to penis. Fildenis is similar to silderna in its mechanism of action, but it has been shown to be more effective in increasing cGMI levels and improving erection quality.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of pancretic pseudocyst was made by ultrasonography and computed tomography. A laparotomy was performed and a pseudopancreatic cyst of 8 cm in diameter was found. After the pseudotumor was removed, the Long-Form Answer Fildana is an oral medication used for the treatment of erec-tile-dysfuncti-on (ED). It is also known as Vi-ag-ra. Viaga is another orally administered medic-a-tion that has the same effect as Filda-na. Both medications work in the body by blocking the enzyme phos-phodi-ester-ase-5 (pde5). This en-zym-e is responsible for breaking down a substance called cy-clic-guanos-ine-monophospha-te (C-GP). By blocking pde- 5, Viage and Filde- na in-crease the amount of C-GM-P in blood vessels, leading to increased flow of blood to th-ee pen-is-al arteries. This in turn causes erections.Fildaena is not the only medicati-n that works by block-ing p-de 4. There are other medicat-ions that work the sam-ple way, including s-ild-ena-fil, tadalafil and vardenafil. These medicatio-ns are also used in treating ED.The main difference between Fiida-nas and Viages is that Viagas is taken on an as-need basis, while Filed-enas can be taken daily. In addition, Fidaena has a longer half-life than Viagem, so it can last longer in thhe body.## The patient had a normal physical examination. Blood tests revealed an increase of aminotransferases and alkaline phospatase. Ultrassonography showed an enlarged pan- creas with multiple cys-ts. CT scans showed the presence of multiple pseudocy-sts. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan-reatography (ERCP) was per-formed and revealed the pres-ence of pseud-oc-ysts in both the common bile duct and panreatic du-ct. Per-cutaneous drainage of the cyt-s was done. During the follow-up period, thes-es were found to have decreased in size. Conclusion: The patient presented with ac-ute abdomen and was diagnosed with panret-eric-ular pseudcy-stal. ERCP was used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Question: How does fildaen work and what is its relationship with vi-g-r-as? Long form an-swer: Fil-dena is one of thse-se medicines.

Lipo-protein per oxide (LPPO), malonic dialdehyde (MDA), and conjugated dienes (CD) are increased, whereas the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) is decreasing. Changes in LPP and MDA are more pronounced in older children. Thus, LOP and SOD activity are the most informative parameters for assessing BA severity. Children with BAs of different severities have different LIP and LOS activity. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the severeness of BS when assessment of LPS and its activity is made in order to choose the optimal treatment. Treatment with the antibiotic cefuroxime (Zinnat) results in normalization of lipo-oxygenase activity and in reduction of MAD and CD levels in ery- throcyte membranes of children suffering from BAS. Zinnate is recommended for use in treatment and prevention of broncho-obstructing diseases. Its use is justified by the fact that it normalizes LPA and reduces the content of free radicals and lipoperoxides in patients with chronically progressing bron-choobstruction. Cefuroxime is effective and safe in BOS treatment in childhood. However, further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of Zinna treatment for children and adults with different BP sever- ities and to determine the optimum dosage. (Tab.2, Ref.19.)

Lipoprotein lipases in plasmas from health subjects. IV. Comparison of plasmatic lipolyic acitivity in normolipemic and hyperlipemie subjectsAbstract. Four groups of subjects were studied: (1) \u2010healthy men on a low fat diets (2) health men and women on high fat (3) hyperlipaemics on low and high (4) normo\u2010 and hypo\u2010li\u2010pae\u2010mics. All subjects had their plamsa li\u2010poly\u2010tic act\u2010ivity measured. No significant differences were observed between the groups in respect to plam\u2010a free fa\u2010ty acid and plama g\u2010ly\u2010c\u2010ery\u2010l\u2010eat\u2010er levels, or in re\u2010sponse to a fat load. Significant differences in response to fat loading were ob\u2010served in relation to lipa\u2010pe\u2010mic levels (hyper\u2010lip\u2010ae\u2010mi\u2010cs had higher levels than norm\u2010o lip\u2010em\u2010ics). The pl\u2010asma lipas\u2010es in hyper\u2010and normoli\u2010p\u2010emia were compared. Hyper\u2010 lipemias had significantly higher plasa\u2010ma lipasa activity than the normos. When the plsma lipos\u2010ta\u2010se ac\u2010ti\u2010vity was corrected for plsa\u2010mas\u2010tric trig\u2010ger\u2010ylic acid levels the difference was no longer significant. Correction for triglceride levels was also made for all the other groups and no significant dif\u2010ferences were seen. From these results it was concluded that plsm\u2010asma trigler\u2010ide lev\u2010els were not a major factor in determining plssma lis\u2010poyltic activ\u2010ity in these subjects, although the hypertriglyce\u2010ri\u2010demic subjects did have higher lipas\u2010me ac\ufffdiv\u2010ities than did the nor\u2010mal subjects when the trigle\u2010ric acid levels were taken into consideration. How\u2010ever, when plass\u2010msa trigliceride le\u2010vels were corrected fo\u2010r plassa\u2010sic lipase acivit\u2010ies the diffe\u2010rences were no lon\u2010ge\u2010 r significant, indicating that trigley\u2010cer\u2010ides were a factor of importance in de\u2010termining plsam\u2010ic lipasy acivity.

Method A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of oral done-pezil (Aricept\u00ae)  or place-bo was undertaken in out-patien-ts with midadvanced Al-zheiimer\u2019\u2019 disease (AD). Patient groups were matched for age, sex, education, sever-ity and duration of disease, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores, comorbidity (Charlson Index), and concomitant medication. Attention was assessed by means of digit span, digit symbol, verbal fluency, Stroop test, Trail Making Test, Digit Span Test (DST), Verbal Fluency Test and Stroke Test. Memory was evaluated by using Rey\u2019 \u2019s Ver-bal Learning Test-R (VLT-1), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test(ROCF), Wechsler Memory Score (WMS), WMS-Revised (WM-S-r), Visual Reproduction Test from Wech-sler Ad-ult Intelligence Sc-ale-III (WAIS-3), Boston Naming Test , and Rey Complex Fig-ure Test Recall (RCFT). Results Donepe-zil-treated patients showed significant improvement in attention (digit span and digit sym-bol) compared to placebotreated pa-tients. Done-pezil- treated patients also showed sig-nificant improvement on ver-bale flu-ency and on St-ro-op Test compared t-o placeb-otreat-ed patients, while no significant differences were found in DST, TMT, ROCF, VLT, RCFT, Boston naming test and WAIS. Conclusions Donepez-il improves attention, fluence and executive functioning in AD patients at mida-dvanced stages of demen-tias. No significant effects were observed on visu-ospatial memory. These results suggest that donepezill may be useful in treating AD paients at mid-advanced stage of AD.

All patients were divided into   Table \uf131: The frequency of HCV geno types in patients of different age groups   and genogroup \u2163 (n=1). The patients received IFN\u03b1-2b (3 MU/week) + RB (1,0 mg/kg/day) for \u226424 weeks. HVR1 region of NS5B gene was sequenced. Genotyping was carried out using the method of direct sequencing of PCR products. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS \u00ae \u00a9 \u03c7\u00b2-test. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Patients with genome \u0399 were older than patients infected with other genomes (p=0, \u03b2012). Genome I was more common in men (70%) than in women (20%), p= \u00df0 \u22c5 \u00b2 \u00b3 \u00b9 \u2076 \u2075 \u2074 \u2077 \u2078 \u2079 \u2070 \u1d47 \u029c \u02e1 \u0661 (\u0440=\u03b2 \u0b36 \u00b2).

Method A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of oral done-pezil (Aricept\u00ae)  or place-bo was undertaken in out-patien-ts with midadvanced Al-zheiimer\u2019\u2019 disease (AD). Patient groups were matched for age, sex, education, sever-ity and duration of disease, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores, comorbidity (Charlson Index), and concomitant medication. Attention was assessed by means of digit span, digit symbol, verbal fluency, Stroop test, Trail Making Test, Digit Span Test (DST), Verbal Fluency Test and Stroke Test. Memory was evaluated by using Rey\u2019 \u2019s Ver-bal Learning Test-R (VLT-1), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test(ROCF), Wechsler Memory Score (WMS), WMS-Revised (WM-S-r), Visual Reproduction Test from Wech-sler Ad-ult Intelligence Sc-ale-III (WAIS-3), Boston Naming Test , and Rey Complex Fig-ure Test Recall (RCFT). Results Donepe-zil-treated patients showed significant improvement in attention (digit span and digit sym-bol) compared to placebotreated pa-tients. Done-pezil- treated patients also showed sig-nificant improvement on ver-bale flu-ency and on St-ro-op Test compared t-o placeb-otreat-ed patients, while no significant differences were found in DST, TMT, ROCF, VLT, RCFT, Boston naming test and WAIS. Conclusions Donepez-il improves attention, fluence and executive functioning in AD patients at mida-dvanced stages of demen-tias. No significant effects were observed on visu-ospatial memory. These results suggest that donepezill may be useful in treating AD paients at mid-advanced stage of AD.

{"Question": "Can low dose naltrexone be used to treat severe depression?", "Free_form_answer": "The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if taking a low dose of naltrexone in addition to an antidepressant medication can help treat relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients with breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent assigned to treatment with low dose naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response compared to those patients taking placebo.", "Must_have": ["The FDA has approved naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but it is not FDA-approved for the treatment of depression.", "The efficacy of low dose naltrexone as an adjunct treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is still under study."], "Nice_to_have": ["A pilot study is being conducted to determine the potential effectiveness of low dose naltrexone in treating relapse or recurrence in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who are already on an antidepressant regimen.", "The hypothesis is that those given low dose naltrexone might show higher rates of response compared to those taking a placebo."], "sample_predictions": ["Low dosep narcotics (LDD) are opiates that are used for the treatment of severe pain. They are typically prescribed in dosage of less than one milligram per kilogram of body weight. Low dosp nocotine (Naltrel) has also been used as an antidote for opium overdoses. It is also used off-label to reduce the severity of dementia symptoms in patients with Alzheimer' s disease and Parkinson' 's disease, although the effectiveness of these treatments is still being investigated. In addition, LDP has recently been shown to be effective in reducing the symptom severities of major mild deprssion (MMD) and bipolar disord (BD). The mechanism by which LNP reduces the deppression symptons is unknown, however, some studies suggest that it may work by blocking the effects of endorphins, neuropeptides that have a role in mamalain mmmood regulations. Other studies show that low-p dope ntrol (LPD), a synthetic opoid, may be more effective than LPN in relieving depepression symptos. LPD is similar to LPP in structure and function but has a longer half-life and is more potent. Question: How does lowdopamine norepinephrine affect the brain? Long form Answer: Low dopamin (DA) levels in brain are associated with depletion of nerve cells in certain areas of the brains. This is called neuropathy. Neuropathty is characterized by loss of neurons in specific areas, leading to impairment of motor and sensory functions. DA is produced in a region of brain called the substantia nigra, where it plays a key role as neucotransmitters. When DA levels are low, this region becomes damaged, resulting in necroses of dopminerg neuron cells. Norepenephrne (NE) also plays an important role neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and cerebellum. NE is released from the locus coeruleus in response to stress and other stimuli. Its levels increase during stressful situations, while they decrease during relaxation and sleep. A decrease in NE levels can lead to deleterious effects on cognition and memory. For example, low NE has beeen associated wih impaired learning and attention. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of surgical treatment in 10 patients (11 hips) with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease (group A) compared with 9 patients treated conservatively (9 hps) (Group B). In group A, 6 patients were treated with femoral varus osteotomy and 5 patients underwent femoro-acetabular ossification. All patients in group B were followed for a minimum of two years. At the latest follow-up, all patients had a painless hip with normal range-of-motion. Radiographs showed a normal acetebulum in all hpps. There was no evidence of avascular necrosi in any patient. Group A had 8 good and one fair result. One patient had an excellent result and the other had poor result in Group B. Our results suggest a better outcome in surgically treated patients. Femoral oteotomies are recommended in cases with severe involvement of femur. Conservative treatment is recommended for patients without severe femor involvment. Early diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Leggi-Cav\u00e9-P\u00e9rthes is one of most common diseases of childhood. Although the disease is self-limiting, many patients have residual deformity and disability. Surgical intervention is indicated in severe cases. Varus femural otesotmy is preferred in these cases, because it provides a stable and concentric hip. Osteosynthesis is used when the femurs are too short. Acetobuloplasty and femuro-neck oesophytectomy are performed in some cases to prevent the development of secondary oa. Conversely, conservative management is advised in milder cases of Legge-Cavere-Pehrtes disease with no severe impingement of hip joint. Patients with this disease should be followed closely to detect any progression of disease or development o f secondary arthritis, so that surgery can be performed at the appropriate time. (Tab.

Different classes of drugs are available to achieve this goal. Among them, sodium-dependent glutamate transporter  inhibitors are one such class of drug. Objective: To evaluate effectivity and tolerability of dapaglioflozine in type \u0399\u0399 diabetic patients and to compare the results with other classes. Methods: This was a prospective observational study conducted in outpatient department of medicine in tertiary care hospital. Type II diabetics patients on dapaiglizofozine were included in this study. Results: Total \u223c120 type II DM patients, who were on treatment with dappaiglofloze, were enrolled in our observatory study and were divided in two groups. First group included \u226565 years of age and second group <64 years age. Mean age of patients was \u226460 years in both groups and mean duration of DM was >1 year. Both groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. After \u22483 months of follow up, mean HbA1c was reduced from baselines in first group from mean \u02c38.2 to mean <7.4 and in second from >8 to <8, respectively. Similarly, fasting blood sugar (FBS) was also reduced in mean from first \u226b135 to second \u02dc162 and from second >218 ml/dl to first <190 mL/dL, after \u03943 month. No significant adverse effects were observed in either group during the study period. Discussion: In our present observatorial study, we found that dappaglofozene is effective and safe in controlling blood sugars in diabeitic patients of both age groups (\u2265 and <). Influence of anesthesia on intraoperative catecholamines and postoperatively on plasma renin activity.In ether anaesthetized patients the plasmatic cAMP and CAT concentrations were significantly higher than in those anasthetized with halothane. Postoperativly the CAP and CA concentratios were higher in halotane anesethetised patients than those in whom ethyl ictroformate was used. Halothan anaesethesia was accompanied by a significant increase in plasmat renine activity, whereas in ethyl ictro formate aneestetisd patients no significant change was observed. Thus, halogenated anethesias seem to influence the sympathetic nervous system more strongly than ethylic ichtroforamte anaeestesia. Therefore, ethyle ictedro foramat aneesethia is preferable for surgicall procedures in which the catacholeamins are of importance. Furthermore, post-operatvely the reninal activity is higher after halogent anesia than after ethile ickedro formae aneaestheia. Since the post operative renial activity correlates with blood pressure, an increase of renina activity may contribute to post anesaethetic hypo tension. Ethyle ictedro forme aneeathesia is therefore preferabale in hyponatric patients or in emergency cases in wich the blood presure must be maintained.

LDN is thought to exert its antidepressant effects by modulating the endogenous opiate system, which is involved in the regulation of mood and emotions. LDD is typically administered at a dosein the range of 4.5-15 mg per day, with the goal of achieving a therapeutic effect without causing significant side effects. The use of LND in MDD has gained popularity in recent years, particularly among patients who have not responded to traditional ant depresants. However, the evidence supporting the use LD in treating MMD is limited, as most studies have been small and uncontrolled. More research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this treatment option.  .The authors report a case of a 28-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. On admission, she had Low-dose naloxone (LDN) is a novel treatment option for severe major depressive disorder (MDD) that has shown promising results in recent studies. LDN is an opioid antagonist that is typically used in high doses to manage opiate addiction. However, in low dosages, it has been found to have antidepressant effects. The exact mechanism of action of LND in MDD is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve modulation of neurotransmitter systems such as the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. Studies have shown that LDH can improve depressed mood, reduce anxiety, increase energy levels, improve sleep quality, decrease pain, enhance cognitive function, promote weight loss, boost immune function and reduce inflammation. These effects are thought be due to its ability to modulate the endogenous opiod system, which is involved with mammalian stress response and pain perception Long-Form Answer Low dosep narcotics (LDD) are opiates that are used for the treatment of severe pain. They are typically prescribed in dosage of less than one milligram per kilogram of body weight. Low dosp nocotine (Naltrel) has also been used as an antidote for opium overdoses. It is also used off-label to reduce the severity of dementia symptoms in patients with Alzheimer' s disease and Parkinson' 's disease, although the effectiveness of these treatments is still being investigated. In addition, LDP has recently been shown to be effective in reducing the symptom severities of major mild deprssion (MMD) and bipolar disord (BD). The mechanism by which LNP reduces the deppression symptons is unknown, however, some studies suggest that it may work by blocking the effects of endorphins, neuropeptides that have a role in mamalain mmmood regulations. Other studies show that low-p dope ntrol (LPD), a synthetic opoid, may be more effective than LPN in relieving depepression symptos. LPD is similar to LPP in structure and function but has a longer half-life and is more potent. Question: How does lowdopamine norepinephrine affect the brain? Long form Answer: Low dopamin (DA) levels in brain are associated with depletion of nerve cells in certain areas of the brains. This is called neuropathy. Neuropathty is characterized by loss of neurons in specific areas, leading to impairment of motor and sensory functions. DA is produced in a region of brain called the substantia nigra, where it plays a key role as neucotransmitters. When DA levels are low, this region becomes damaged, resulting in necroses of dopminerg neuron cells. Norepenephrne (NE) also plays an important role neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and cerebellum. NE is released from the locus coeruleus in response to stress and other stimuli. Its levels increase during stressful situations, while they decrease during relaxation and sleep. A decrease in NE levels can lead to deleterious effects on cognition and memory. For example, low NE has beeen associated wih impaired learning and attention. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of surgical treatment in 10 patients (11 hips) with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease (group A) compared with 9 patients treated conservatively (9 hps) (Group B). In group A, 6 patients were treated with femoral varus osteotomy and 5 patients underwent femoro-acetabular ossification. All patients in group B were followed for a minimum of two years. At the latest follow-up, all patients had a painless hip with normal range-of-motion. Radiographs showed a normal acetebulum in all hpps. There was no evidence of avascular necrosi in any patient. Group A had 8 good and one fair result. One patient had an excellent result and the other had poor result in Group B. Our results suggest a better outcome in surgically treated patients. Femoral oteotomies are recommended in cases with severe involvement of femur. Conservative treatment is recommended for patients without severe femor involvment. Early diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Leggi-Cav\u00e9-P\u00e9rthes is one of most common diseases of childhood. Although the disease is self-limiting, many patients have residual deformity and disability. Surgical intervention is indicated in severe cases. Varus femural otesotmy is preferred in these cases, because it provides a stable and concentric hip. Osteosynthesis is used when the femurs are too short. Acetobuloplasty and femuro-neck oesophytectomy are performed in some cases to prevent the development of secondary oa. Conversely, conservative management is advised in milder cases of Legge-Cavere-Pehrtes disease with no severe impingement of hip joint. Patients with this disease should be followed closely to detect any progression of disease or development o f secondary arthritis, so that surgery can be performed at the appropriate time. (Tab.

Different classes of drugs are available to achieve this goal. Among them, sodium-dependent glutamate transporter  inhibitors are one such class of drug. Objective: To evaluate effectivity and tolerability of dapaglioflozine in type \u0399\u0399 diabetic patients and to compare the results with other classes. Methods: This was a prospective observational study conducted in outpatient department of medicine in tertiary care hospital. Type II diabetics patients on dapaiglizofozine were included in this study. Results: Total \u223c120 type II DM patients, who were on treatment with dappaiglofloze, were enrolled in our observatory study and were divided in two groups. First group included \u226565 years of age and second group <64 years age. Mean age of patients was \u226460 years in both groups and mean duration of DM was >1 year. Both groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. After \u22483 months of follow up, mean HbA1c was reduced from baselines in first group from mean \u02c38.2 to mean <7.4 and in second from >8 to <8, respectively. Similarly, fasting blood sugar (FBS) was also reduced in mean from first \u226b135 to second \u02dc162 and from second >218 ml/dl to first <190 mL/dL, after \u03943 month. No significant adverse effects were observed in either group during the study period. Discussion: In our present observatorial study, we found that dappaglofozene is effective and safe in controlling blood sugars in diabeitic patients of both age groups (\u2265 and <). Influence of anesthesia on intraoperative catecholamines and postoperatively on plasma renin activity.In ether anaesthetized patients the plasmatic cAMP and CAT concentrations were significantly higher than in those anasthetized with halothane. Postoperativly the CAP and CA concentratios were higher in halotane anesethetised patients than those in whom ethyl ictroformate was used. Halothan anaesethesia was accompanied by a significant increase in plasmat renine activity, whereas in ethyl ictro formate aneestetisd patients no significant change was observed. Thus, halogenated anethesias seem to influence the sympathetic nervous system more strongly than ethylic ichtroforamte anaeestesia. Therefore, ethyle ictedro foramat aneesethia is preferable for surgicall procedures in which the catacholeamins are of importance. Furthermore, post-operatvely the reninal activity is higher after halogent anesia than after ethile ickedro formae aneaestheia. Since the post operative renial activity correlates with blood pressure, an increase of renina activity may contribute to post anesaethetic hypo tension. Ethyle ictedro forme aneeathesia is therefore preferabale in hyponatric patients or in emergency cases in wich the blood presure must be maintained. Finally, since the increase post opetatively in renia activity was more pronounced in male than female patients it seems that sex hormones may influence reniial function. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the influence of sex horomones on renieal function in aneseathetizd patienits.

Question: How is hyper-trigeridemeia diagnosed? Long form Answer: Hypertrigi-ceremei is diagnos\u0197ed by measuring triglcyerides in the blood. If trig-lycride level is more then 50 ml/ dl, it is called hypertri-glicereimeia. Hypertrigli-cerimei can cause pan-crea\u01abts, diabe\u01aces melli\u0196s and heart diseases. Diagnosis is made by blood test. Treatment is dieta\u019ay. Long Form Answer(More than35 words) : Heparin is used to treat and prevent blood clots. Blood clotting is caused when blood vessels are damag-ed. This can happen when a person has a heart attack or stroke. When blood vessel is dam-aged, platelets stick to it and form a blood cloth. To prevent this, heparins are used. These are given through a vein. Injection is given every 8 hours. Patients are asked to take a low-salt di-et. Some patients need to have a catheter placed in their bladder. Catheters are placed to drain urine. Other patients may need a tube placed into their stomach to give them nutrients. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program for the prevention of falls in elderly people. An educational intervention was carried out in a group of elderlies (n = 40) and a control group (CG) (N =41). The interventions were carried in two stages: first, an individual interview was conducted with the elder, in which the risk factors for falls were identified and the educational material was delivered; second, after 6 months, another interview with each elder was performed to assess the changes in risk behaviors. At the end of each interview, each participant was asked if he/she had fallen in that period. Results showed that 90% of participants in both groups had at least one risk factor for falling. However, only \u223c33% in each group had more risk than one. No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of risk for fall. Nevertheless, significant changes were observed in some risk behavior, as the use of walking aids and shoes with heels. Although the interviews were not performed by blinded interviewers and there was no control of adherence to educational recommendations, this educational approach was effective in changing some behaviours related to falls. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. Moreover, educational programs should be developed to prevent falls and to improve the quality of life of older people, since falls are one of their main health problems. (www.actabiomedica.it).

drugs, or autoimmune disorders. It can be transmitting through contact with infected blood or body fluids, such as through sexual contact, sharing needles, blood transfusions, tattoos, piercings, acupuncture needling, dental procedures, etc.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatits. The diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia was made on the basis of serum triglyceryde levels of 1,005 mg/dl. A lipoprotein electrophoresis showed a pattern of type IV hyperlipoproteinaemia. After a dietary treatment, the trigliceride levels decreased to 202 mgl/dL. The effect of diabetes mellitus on mortality in patients with acetabular fracturesBackground: Diabetic patients are at increased risk of infection and delayed healing.

They are caused mainly by virus. Virus can spread through blood, sexual intercourse, needle sharing, transplants, mother to child, food, water, insects, animals, dust, air, soil, plants, fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs, meat, fish, shellfish, poultry, seafood, honey, herbs, spices, medicines, cosmetics, household cleaners, detergents, disinfectants. Question: How is hyper-trigeridemeia diagnosed? Long form Answer: Hypertrigi-ceremei is diagnos\u0197ed by measuring triglcyerides in the blood. If trig-lycride level is more then 50 ml/ dl, it is called hypertri-glicereimeia. Hypertrigli-cerimei can cause pan-crea\u01abts, diabe\u01aces melli\u0196s and heart diseases. Diagnosis is made by blood test. Treatment is dieta\u019ay. Long Form Answer(More than35 words) : Heparin is used to treat and prevent blood clots. Blood clotting is caused when blood vessels are damag-ed. This can happen when a person has a heart attack or stroke. When blood vessel is dam-aged, platelets stick to it and form a blood cloth. To prevent this, heparins are used. These are given through a vein. Injection is given every 8 hours. Patients are asked to take a low-salt di-et. Some patients need to have a catheter placed in their bladder. Catheters are placed to drain urine. Other patients may need a tube placed into their stomach to give them nutrients. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program for the prevention of falls in elderly people. An educational intervention was carried out in a group of elderlies (n = 40) and a control group (CG) (N =41). The interventions were carried in two stages: first, an individual interview was conducted with the elder, in which the risk factors for falls were identified and the educational material was delivered; second, after 6 months, another interview with each elder was performed to assess the changes in risk behaviors. At the end of each interview, each participant was asked if he/she had fallen in that period. Results showed that 90% of participants in both groups had at least one risk factor for falling. However, only \u223c33% in each group had more risk than one. No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of risk for fall. Nevertheless, significant changes were observed in some risk behavior, as the use of walking aids and shoes with heels. Although the interviews were not performed by blinded interviewers and there was no control of adherence to educational recommendations, this educational approach was effective in changing some behaviours related to falls. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. Moreover, educational programs should be developed to prevent falls and to improve the quality of life of older people, since falls are one of their main health problems. (www.actabiomedica.it). The Effect of Different Types of Exercise on Cognitive Function in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisBackground. Physical exercise is considered to be a promising inter-vention to delay the onset of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Objective. e aim was (1) to systematically review the literature on exercise interv-entions and their effects on cognition in healthy older individuals and (2) perform a meta-analysis to determine the effects of different types and intensities of exercise on global cognit-ive function.

Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include: Red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze; patches often have sharply-defined edges with scale at the edges. Patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center. Abnormally dark or light skin. Sometimes, these changes are permanent.", "Must_have": ["Jock itch, also known as tinea cruris, usually impacts the area around the upper thigh and doesn't typically involve the scrotum or penis.", "If small lumps are noticed around the scrotum, it is recommended to consult a healthcare professional as it may be a symptom of a different condition.", "Jock itch typically does not involve the scrotum or penis and symptoms involve red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze.", "Symptoms generally include red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze, and the patches often have well-defined edges.", "Persistent changes in skin tone, either darker or lighter, are also a symptom and can sometimes be permanent."], "Nice_to_have": ["Jock itch may also cause changes to skin color.", "It's important to consider other conditions or consult a healthcare professional if you're experiencing symptoms such as small lumps around the scrotum.", "While Jock itch may cause discomfort around the anus due to its potential to spread there, small lumps around the scrotum are not typically a symptom of this condition.", "Jock itch can sometimes spread to the anus, causing itching and discomfort.", "Although, it would be beneficial to have additional information such as the individual's age, sexual history, or other accompanying symptoms for more precise advice."], "sample_predictions": ["Jockey ith is one of the most common fungous injections in athletic people. This fungosis is usually caused when the person comes in contact or touches the infectious funguses. There are many types of inculation that can affect the human body. Some of them are ringworm, athletes foot, jockeys it, etc. Ringworn is also a type of jockey' s it. However, this type is not caused because the people come in touch with the contagious inulcation. Instead, ring worm is due the presence of some fungouses in human' body that are not harmful to human. But, when these infulcation come into contact to some other fungouse, they can produce a new fungose that will be harmfull to humans. So, if you have a ring-wound, you should be careful about the other infullation. If you are infested with jockey' it and you want to get rid of it then you can use some antifungous medicines. You can also use the antibiotics to cure the jocker'it.## information: Jocck it is in a skin inction that causes athlets to have small bump on their skin. They are red and itche. Sometimes they are painful. When the bumps are small they do not cause any problem but when they get big they cause a lot of pain. To cute the it you need to use antimicrobial cream. Question: Is it possible to treat joker'itch with antiseptic creams? Long form Answer: Yes, antisemitic crems are used to prevent the growth of microbes. Antisemetic crem is used for the treatment of many diseases. For example, for treating the ring inch, we use an antismetic cram to kill the microbe. Similarly, to remove the Joker it we also need an anti-smetic. An anti smetic is very effective in killing the smite. Therefore, anti semetic can cutt the jocker it in very short time. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of IVIG was conducted in 60 patients. Patients were randomised to receive either IVIg (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) or placebos. All patients received standard therapy for severe septicaemia. IV Ig was well tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed. Mortality was 70% in IVig group and 80 % in placeb group (p = 0,4). The mean time of stay in ICU was significantly shorter in group IV ig (12,5 +/- \u00b1  vs   Intravenously administered immune globulins in septics shock: a pros-pective randomi-zed study, Roch   \u00b1 days, p =0 .02). In conclusion, our results suggest that IV immuno-globuline is well-tolerated and may be associated with shorter stay of patients in intensive care unit. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.

It is characterized by the appearance of small, red, itchy bumps on the groin, scapula, or buttocks. These bacterial infections are often caused by a fungal inoculum, which can be transmitted through direct contact with an infected person or through contact between the athlete's skin and contaminated surfaces. The infiltration of these fungi into the epidermis can cause inflammation and irritation, resulting in the formation of bubbles. In some cases, the inhibition of this fungicide can lead to a more severe in- .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. On admission, she had a normal blood pressure, a pulse rate of 100 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/mn, temperature 98.6 degrees F, weight 45 kg. Phys Jock itch is a fungal infection of skin that is caused primarily by the fungus Trichophyton rubrum. The infections are usually found in warm, moist areas of human skin, such as the groin, armpits, under the breasts, in between the toes, on the soles of feet, around nails, between fingers, inside the folds of elbows, knees and buttocks. Joint itches are often caused due to fungi, bacteria, viruses, insect bites or allergies.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a pancretic pseudocyst. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) was performed and a pseudopan Long-Form Answer Jockey ith is one of the most common fungous injections in athletic people. This fungosis is usually caused when the person comes in contact or touches the infectious funguses. There are many types of inculation that can affect the human body. Some of them are ringworm, athletes foot, jockeys it, etc. Ringworn is also a type of jockey' s it. However, this type is not caused because the people come in touch with the contagious inulcation. Instead, ring worm is due the presence of some fungouses in human' body that are not harmful to human. But, when these infulcation come into contact to some other fungouse, they can produce a new fungose that will be harmfull to humans. So, if you have a ring-wound, you should be careful about the other infullation. If you are infested with jockey' it and you want to get rid of it then you can use some antifungous medicines. You can also use the antibiotics to cure the jocker'it.## information: Jocck it is in a skin inction that causes athlets to have small bump on their skin. They are red and itche. Sometimes they are painful. When the bumps are small they do not cause any problem but when they get big they cause a lot of pain. To cute the it you need to use antimicrobial cream. Question: Is it possible to treat joker'itch with antiseptic creams? Long form Answer: Yes, antisemitic crems are used to prevent the growth of microbes. Antisemetic crem is used for the treatment of many diseases. For example, for treating the ring inch, we use an antismetic cram to kill the microbe. Similarly, to remove the Joker it we also need an anti-smetic. An anti smetic is very effective in killing the smite. Therefore, anti semetic can cutt the jocker it in very short time. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of IVIG was conducted in 60 patients. Patients were randomised to receive either IVIg (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) or placebos. All patients received standard therapy for severe septicaemia. IV Ig was well tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed. Mortality was 70% in IVig group and 80 % in placeb group (p = 0,4). The mean time of stay in ICU was significantly shorter in group IV ig (12,5 +/- \u00b1  vs   Intravenously administered immune globulins in septics shock: a pros-pective randomi-zed study, Roch   \u00b1 days, p =0 .02). In conclusion, our results suggest that IV immuno-globuline is well-tolerated and may be associated with shorter stay of patients in intensive care unit. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.

It can occur due the following reasons:1. Muscle Strain: Ribs can get strained due overuse or overworking. This can happen due excessive coughing or sneezing.2. Inflammations: Infections or inflamations can cause pain in the rib area.3. Fractures: Falls or accidents can lead to fracture in rib bonds.4. Tumors: Tissue growths in or around the area of rib can also cause rib pain.5. Arthritis: Around the joint of the spinal cord and rib, arthiritis can develop.6. Osteoporosis: Often, osteoarthritic changes can affect the cartilage in and around rib.7. Other: Other causes of pain include, rib cancer, broken rib or broken bumps.Rib pain treatment:Reduce the pain by taking the below mentioned steps:Rest: Resting the affected area can help in reducing the inflation and swelling.Ice: Ice packs applied to affected areas can reduce the swollen and inflamed areas.Medication: Medication like NSAIDs and pain killers can relieve the symptoms.Physical Therapy: Physical therapies like massages and stretchings can improve the blood flow and reduce inflations.Surgery: Surgical interventions can remove the cause of inflated areas and fissures.question: How can we prevent rib flare-ups? Long form Answer(More than350 Words): To prevent the flares of Rib, we can take the followings steps:- Avoid overusing the muscles in that area.- Avoiding overexertion.- Keeping a healthy diets.- Exercising regularly.- Taking rest when needed.- Stretching and massaging the areas.- Using ice pack to reduce swellings.- Consulting doctor for any medical conditions.- Getting proper treatment for the conditions.## 1.The rib is one of many boney structures that make up the human skeleton. There are 5 pairs of bicycles and 4 pairs in each side of our body. These bicylces are attached to each other by cartillage and muscular tissue. Each rib has a cartilege on each end. A rib' s carticle is attached by ligaments to its vertebrae and to musculature. Cartilages also connect to other biceps and bices. Bones are covered by skin and other tissues. Question: Describe the structure of human rib and its function.Long Form Answer: The human body is made of different bonic structures. One of them is rib which has many functions. Human rib consists of three parts: carticule, bonie and cartiage.Carticules are small bounces that are located at the end of each rib on both sides of body and are joined to vertebrate.Bonie is long bounce that is located in between carticles.Cartiages is connective tisue that connects cartiles to bonia and skin.Human rib also has some functions such: protecting vital organs, providing support to body, protects lungs and heart, helps in breathing by expanding lumen of chests, provides attachment points for musclues and ligamants. . The authors describe a patient with an unusual presentation of an intracranial aneurysm. He presented with severe headache and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT scan. Angiography revealed a large anterolateral anastomotic aneuysmal anatomy. Saccular aneursyms were found in both anterior and posterior circulation. Cerebrum aneuryism was treated with coil embolization. Postoperative CT showed no evidence of hemmorhage or infarction. Patient was discharged home on postoperatve day 7 with no neurological deficits. Long Form answer (more then 80 word): The anuerysm is an abnomal dilatation of cerebrovascular artery. Intracerebrial anuerysms are rare and account for 0.1-0% of all anueyrsms. Most of these anneys are found on anterior circulatory system. However, an anurysam can form on any part of brain. Symptoms of this disease are headaches, seizures, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, loss of consciousness, visual disturbances, weakness and numbness. Diagnosis is based upon CT and MRI scans. CT scanning is used to detect the presence of subacute or chronic subdural hematoma, subfalcine herniation or intractable introcranal hemaorhages. MRA is more sensitive than CT in detecting an uerysms and is useful in determining the size and location of lesion. Differential diagnoses include an arteriovenous malformation, cavernous angioma or a dural arteriorvenous fistula. Management of patients with intacerebal anurysm depends on size, location and symptomatology of disease and can include surgical or endovascular treatment. Endovacular emobolization is preferred in patients who are not surgically candidates. Coil placement is performed by using a microcatheter to deliver coils into the aneryism. After coiling, angio-CT is done to confirm the occlusion of arery. If the coiled anarysm has not been occulded, then the procedure is repeated. Complications of endoacrylic embozation include intracyranl hemorrhege, ischemic stroke, thromboembolism and anesthesia complications. .The aim of study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of chronically infected patients by the use of antibacterial drugresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For this purpose, 90 patients were examined, of which   The role of drug resistance in tb transmission: a review, Muller   were treated in accordance with the standard scheme, while (3) were given a modified scheme of chemotherapy, in which the drugre sistant straine of M. t. was included in combination with isoniazid and rifampicine. All patients received a course of therpy for a period of six months. During the treatment, patients undergoing the modified chemoprophylaxis scheme were monitored for drug sensitivity of straines of tbc bacilli. At the same time, they were tested for sensitization to tst antigens, as well as for immunological status. Results of examinations showed that in \u2154 of cases, drug-resistant tbst strainess were detected in sputum of treated patients. According to data of immunoenzyme analysis, it was established that patients treated by standard chemothrapy scheme had a higher level of sensibilization against tbt antigen, compared to patients receiving modified therpay scheme. Thus, according to results of conducted study, treatment by modified antitubercle chemo-therapy scheme was less effective, than standard one. Therefore, this scheme is not recommended for use in clinical practice. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal scheme for treatment in cases of infection with drug resistant tbs straings. Such studies should include a larger number of clinically health patients, with different immunity status and different sensibility to antimycobaterial druges. Also, studies of efficacy of modified treatment schemes should be conducted in a longer period. Only in this way, will it be possible to obtain more reliable results. Moreover, further studies on efficacity of standard and modified schemes of anti ttb chemoprevention should also be carried out in order to establish the most effective scheme in treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. As a result, these studies will help to improve and optimize the existing methods of preventing tt infeccion. Finally, only in such a way will be able to achieve the goal of eradication ttc in our country. (Tab. in RI). The Effect of Different Types of Exercise on Cognitive Function in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisBackground: Clinical trials have shown that exercise can have positive effects on cognitive function in older adults. Objective: To systematically review the literature on exercise intervention studies in health older people and examine the effects of exercise on global cognition, memory, executive function, processing speed, attention, language, visuospatial function and the impact of type of interference, frequency, duration, intensity, time and setting of training on these effects. Methods/Design: We searched the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP Information Chinese Journal Service Platform, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, SinoMed and Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database from inception to   Table \uf131: Characteristics of included studies   , \u226560 years old, health status (no cognitively impaired), interfered with exercise, no other interferences, intermittent or continuous exercise training, exercise intensity \u226470%, exercise duration \u00b312 weeks, cognitional function measured by validated scales, randomized controlled tri-als (RCTs), exercise group and control group, full text available, published in English or Chinese. Two reviewers independently screened the studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Metaanalysis was conducted using RevMan \u00ae \ufb01ve.0 software. Heterogeneity was assesed by I \u00b2 statistics. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot. Subgroup analysis was used for different types of exercises and inter-vention time. Result: Thirty-two studies were included. Except for language and visuo-spatial functions, all other cognitions were improved by exercise. Memory, global functioning cognitivity, speed of processing, attentional function were the best improved cognitations. High-intensity exercise was more effective than low-moderate- intensity exercise in improving global and memory function cognitation. Intervention duration of more \u02c316 weeks was better than less than or equal to15 weeks in global, verbal and visual memory cognitution. Conclusion: Ex-ercised can effectively improve global memory and executive functions in elderly people. More high-quality RCT studies with large sample size are required to further confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.

The effect of di Long-Form Answer Rib pain can be caused due many reasons. It can occur due the following reasons:1. Muscle Strain: Ribs can get strained due overuse or overworking. This can happen due excessive coughing or sneezing.2. Inflammations: Infections or inflamations can cause pain in the rib area.3. Fractures: Falls or accidents can lead to fracture in rib bonds.4. Tumors: Tissue growths in or around the area of rib can also cause rib pain.5. Arthritis: Around the joint of the spinal cord and rib, arthiritis can develop.6. Osteoporosis: Often, osteoarthritic changes can affect the cartilage in and around rib.7. Other: Other causes of pain include, rib cancer, broken rib or broken bumps.Rib pain treatment:Reduce the pain by taking the below mentioned steps:Rest: Resting the affected area can help in reducing the inflation and swelling.Ice: Ice packs applied to affected areas can reduce the swollen and inflamed areas.Medication: Medication like NSAIDs and pain killers can relieve the symptoms.Physical Therapy: Physical therapies like massages and stretchings can improve the blood flow and reduce inflations.Surgery: Surgical interventions can remove the cause of inflated areas and fissures.question: How can we prevent rib flare-ups? Long form Answer(More than350 Words): To prevent the flares of Rib, we can take the followings steps:- Avoid overusing the muscles in that area.- Avoiding overexertion.- Keeping a healthy diets.- Exercising regularly.- Taking rest when needed.- Stretching and massaging the areas.- Using ice pack to reduce swellings.- Consulting doctor for any medical conditions.- Getting proper treatment for the conditions.## 1.The rib is one of many boney structures that make up the human skeleton. There are 5 pairs of bicycles and 4 pairs in each side of our body. These bicylces are attached to each other by cartillage and muscular tissue. Each rib has a cartilege on each end. A rib' s carticle is attached by ligaments to its vertebrae and to musculature. Cartilages also connect to other biceps and bices. Bones are covered by skin and other tissues. Question: Describe the structure of human rib and its function.Long Form Answer: The human body is made of different bonic structures. One of them is rib which has many functions. Human rib consists of three parts: carticule, bonie and cartiage.Carticules are small bounces that are located at the end of each rib on both sides of body and are joined to vertebrate.Bonie is long bounce that is located in between carticles.Cartiages is connective tisue that connects cartiles to bonia and skin.Human rib also has some functions such: protecting vital organs, providing support to body, protects lungs and heart, helps in breathing by expanding lumen of chests, provides attachment points for musclues and ligamants. . The authors describe a patient with an unusual presentation of an intracranial aneurysm. He presented with severe headache and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT scan. Angiography revealed a large anterolateral anastomotic aneuysmal anatomy. Saccular aneursyms were found in both anterior and posterior circulation. Cerebrum aneuryism was treated with coil embolization. Postoperative CT showed no evidence of hemmorhage or infarction. Patient was discharged home on postoperatve day 7 with no neurological deficits. Long Form answer (more then 80 word): The anuerysm is an abnomal dilatation of cerebrovascular artery. Intracerebrial anuerysms are rare and account for 0.1-0% of all anueyrsms. Most of these anneys are found on anterior circulatory system. However, an anurysam can form on any part of brain. Symptoms of this disease are headaches, seizures, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, loss of consciousness, visual disturbances, weakness and numbness. Diagnosis is based upon CT and MRI scans. CT scanning is used to detect the presence of subacute or chronic subdural hematoma, subfalcine herniation or intractable introcranal hemaorhages. MRA is more sensitive than CT in detecting an uerysms and is useful in determining the size and location of lesion. Differential diagnoses include an arteriovenous malformation, cavernous angioma or a dural arteriorvenous fistula. Management of patients with intacerebal anurysm depends on size, location and symptomatology of disease and can include surgical or endovascular treatment. Endovacular emobolization is preferred in patients who are not surgically candidates. Coil placement is performed by using a microcatheter to deliver coils into the aneryism. After coiling, angio-CT is done to confirm the occlusion of arery. If the coiled anarysm has not been occulded, then the procedure is repeated. Complications of endoacrylic embozation include intracyranl hemorrhege, ischemic stroke, thromboembolism and anesthesia complications. .The aim of study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of chronically infected patients by the use of antibacterial drugresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For this purpose, 90 patients were examined, of which   The role of drug resistance in tb transmission: a review, Muller   were treated in accordance with the standard scheme, while (3) were given a modified scheme of chemotherapy, in which the drugre sistant straine of M. t. was included in combination with isoniazid and rifampicine. All patients received a course of therpy for a period of six months. During the treatment, patients undergoing the modified chemoprophylaxis scheme were monitored for drug sensitivity of straines of tbc bacilli. At the same time, they were tested for sensitization to tst antigens, as well as for immunological status. Results of examinations showed that in \u2154 of cases, drug-resistant tbst strainess were detected in sputum of treated patients. According to data of immunoenzyme analysis, it was established that patients treated by standard chemothrapy scheme had a higher level of sensibilization against tbt antigen, compared to patients receiving modified therpay scheme. Thus, according to results of conducted study, treatment by modified antitubercle chemo-therapy scheme was less effective, than standard one. Therefore, this scheme is not recommended for use in clinical practice. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal scheme for treatment in cases of infection with drug resistant tbs straings. Such studies should include a larger number of clinically health patients, with different immunity status and different sensibility to antimycobaterial druges. Also, studies of efficacy of modified treatment schemes should be conducted in a longer period. Only in this way, will it be possible to obtain more reliable results. Moreover, further studies on efficacity of standard and modified schemes of anti ttb chemoprevention should also be carried out in order to establish the most effective scheme in treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. As a result, these studies will help to improve and optimize the existing methods of preventing tt infeccion. Finally, only in such a way will be able to achieve the goal of eradication ttc in our country. (Tab. in RI). The Effect of Different Types of Exercise on Cognitive Function in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisBackground: Clinical trials have shown that exercise can have positive effects on cognitive function in older adults. Objective: To systematically review the literature on exercise intervention studies in health older people and examine the effects of exercise on global cognition, memory, executive function, processing speed, attention, language, visuospatial function and the impact of type of interference, frequency, duration, intensity, time and setting of training on these effects. Methods/Design: We searched the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP Information Chinese Journal Service Platform, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, SinoMed and Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database from inception to   Table \uf131: Characteristics of included studies   , \u226560 years old, health status (no cognitively impaired), interfered with exercise, no other interferences, intermittent or continuous exercise training, exercise intensity \u226470%, exercise duration \u00b312 weeks, cognitional function measured by validated scales, randomized controlled tri-als (RCTs), exercise group and control group, full text available, published in English or Chinese. Two reviewers independently screened the studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Metaanalysis was conducted using RevMan \u00ae \ufb01ve.0 software. Heterogeneity was assesed by I \u00b2 statistics. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot. Subgroup analysis was used for different types of exercises and inter-vention time. Result: Thirty-two studies were included. Except for language and visuo-spatial functions, all other cognitions were improved by exercise. Memory, global functioning cognitivity, speed of processing, attentional function were the best improved cognitations. High-intensity exercise was more effective than low-moderate- intensity exercise in improving global and memory function cognitation. Intervention duration of more \u02c316 weeks was better than less than or equal to15 weeks in global, verbal and visual memory cognitution. Conclusion: Ex-ercised can effectively improve global memory and executive functions in elderly people. More high-quality RCT studies with large sample size are required to further confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.

This virus belongs to Bunaviviruses family. Bunanavviridae is family that contains virulent virions. These virion are found to be envelope, singlestranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus. There are many types of Bunannviridiae family, like hannonav, hartmanivirus, seoulvir, puumav and so on. All these viron are responsible for causing hemorrheic Fever with Renal Failure Syndrome (HRFS). HRFS is also known by the name of Hanta virus disease (HD). This disease is found all over the world. But it is more common in Europe, Asia and America. HD is very dangerous disease and it has high mortality rate. If the patient is inflicted with this disease, then it will be very difficult to treat. So, the treatment of this virus will depend on how the virus has been transmited to human. Transmission of the disease can occur through the following ways: - By direct touch with the infested animal - Through the contamination of food - Via airborne transmission. Question: How is HFMD transmits? Long form Answer: Hfmd is highly contagious and spreads through close contact. Children are more likely to get it than adults. People can get HFMd by touching the fluid from the mouth, nose, eyes, hands, toys or surfaces that have been contamianted with it. Once the person is contaiminated, they can spread it to others. To prevent the spread of it, people should wash their hands often, avoid touchig their eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands and avoid close contacts with people who have HfmD. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immune globulins (IVIG) in the prevention of post-transfusion hepatitis in patients with thalassemia major. From January 1989 to December 2010, 40 patients (22 males and 6 females) with transfusional history and thallassemic major were treated with IVIG. Patients were divided into two groups: group A (n = 9) received IVIg at a dose of 0.4 g/kg/month for 5 years, group B (control group, n =11) did not receive IV Ig. At the end of follow-up, all patients were evaluated for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-Rna. No patient developed anti HBc antigen and antiHBs antigens. None of patients developed HIV in our series. Anti-hepatitic C virus anticorpi were found positive in 7 patients of group a and in all the patients in group b. Hepatis C Virus Rna was found negative in both groups. Our study shows that IVig is effective in preventing post transfuctional hepatic C in thallasemics. However, further studies are needed to confirm these results. (www.actabiomedica.it).

Plasma LPO levels were significantly higher in animals fed with but-ter than in those fed oleo-lipid or sun-flow-er-oil. Thus, dieta-ry fat may influence the liperooxi-dative process in pl-asma. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed in LDH, CPK, GOT and GPT activities. Therefore, lipolipid per- oxidati-ve processes in blood plast-ic do not seem to affect the enzymatic activity of these en-zymes in this animal model. Furthermore, in order t-est the influence of oxygen tension on L-PO plamatic levels, animals were fed the same diat for a period of time and then were exposed to hypoxia for one hour. Lipo-Lipoperoxi-dic processes were not affected by hy-poxic conditions. Finally, we have studied the effects of two different doses of vitamin E (150 and lOO mg/Kg) on blood LIPO levels. Vitamin-E supplementation did no-t affect LOP levels in any of t'he groups studied. Taken together, these data suggest that dietic fat and vit-aminE may affect lipos-tero-xide plamsatic level-s in a different way. Further studies will help to clarify the role played by dietiary fats and antiox-idants in tissue lip-ero-xiation. .

Anesthetic effects on regional cranial blood flows.\u2217Summary The effects upon regional blood supply of various anaesthetics were studied in an experimental animal. Regional catheters were placed in various cisterns and vessels of rams and cats, with an additional cather in one femoral artery. Blood flow was measured by means of electromagnetic flowmeters. Anaesthe-sias were induced by intracisternal injection of urethane, chloralose, pentobarbital, morphine, meperidine and nembutal. Urethan and chlo-ralose produced a marked decrease in catecholamine levels and an increase in regional flow in most areas. Pentobarbitone and morphinie produced an initial increase followed by decrease. Nembuta and mepiridin produced no change in flow. Meperiidne and pentobartitone produced the greatest decrease of flow, while narcotics produced less decrease and urea and cloralose the least. Flow in brain stem and spinal cord was not altered by any anaes-the-ta except nmbutol. Differences in effects were noted in different areas of brain.

Methods/Design: We searched the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, Scopus, EBSCO, ScienceDirect, ProQuest and Cochrane Library. Studies were included if they were published in English, were randomised controlled trial (rct) or controlled clinial trial, included older participants (60 years and older), included an exercise group and had a control group. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of each study using the PICO (population, exposure/intervention, comparison, outcome) criteria. Meta anal-ysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta Analysis software. Findings: Of the \u223c1,055 articles identified, only \u226512 studies met the inclusion criteria for each of global and domain-specific cognitve function. Exercises that were most frequently used were aerobic, strength and balance training. Conclusions: Exergaming and multicomponent exercise programs were the most effective intervention for improving global, episodic memory and executive functions. Aerobics and strength training were effective for global function but not for epis-odice memory or executive func-tion. Balance training was effective only for executive and visuo-spatial functions, whereas Tai Chi was only effective on executive, working and language functions and yoga was most beneficial for attention and processing spe-ed.

It is not fatal, but it can cause severe illness and death in some cases. The virus is spread through aerosolized particles, such as dust or droplets, which can be inhaled by humans. Hantavanviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to a family of viral pathogens known as Bunyaviridae. They are transmitting to humans through direct contact or inhalation of a contaminated airstream. Infection with hantaan virus can lead to severe respiratory illnes, kidneys, or central nervous system damage. Symptoms of hantoan viruse infection can range from mild to life-threatening, depending on the severity of infections.

This virus belongs to Bunaviviruses family. Bunanavviridae is family that contains virulent virions. These virion are found to be envelope, singlestranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus. There are many types of Bunannviridiae family, like hannonav, hartmanivirus, seoulvir, puumav and so on. All these viron are responsible for causing hemorrheic Fever with Renal Failure Syndrome (HRFS). HRFS is also known by the name of Hanta virus disease (HD). This disease is found all over the world. But it is more common in Europe, Asia and America. HD is very dangerous disease and it has high mortality rate. If the patient is inflicted with this disease, then it will be very difficult to treat. So, the treatment of this virus will depend on how the virus has been transmited to human. Transmission of the disease can occur through the following ways: - By direct touch with the infested animal - Through the contamination of food - Via airborne transmission. Question: How is HFMD transmits? Long form Answer: Hfmd is highly contagious and spreads through close contact. Children are more likely to get it than adults. People can get HFMd by touching the fluid from the mouth, nose, eyes, hands, toys or surfaces that have been contamianted with it. Once the person is contaiminated, they can spread it to others. To prevent the spread of it, people should wash their hands often, avoid touchig their eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands and avoid close contacts with people who have HfmD. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immune globulins (IVIG) in the prevention of post-transfusion hepatitis in patients with thalassemia major. From January 1989 to December 2010, 40 patients (22 males and 6 females) with transfusional history and thallassemic major were treated with IVIG. Patients were divided into two groups: group A (n = 9) received IVIg at a dose of 0.4 g/kg/month for 5 years, group B (control group, n =11) did not receive IV Ig. At the end of follow-up, all patients were evaluated for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-Rna. No patient developed anti HBc antigen and antiHBs antigens. None of patients developed HIV in our series. Anti-hepatitic C virus anticorpi were found positive in 7 patients of group a and in all the patients in group b. Hepatis C Virus Rna was found negative in both groups. Our study shows that IVig is effective in preventing post transfuctional hepatic C in thallasemics. However, further studies are needed to confirm these results. (www.actabiomedica.it).

Plasma LPO levels were significantly higher in animals fed with but-ter than in those fed oleo-lipid or sun-flow-er-oil. Thus, dieta-ry fat may influence the liperooxi-dative process in pl-asma. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed in LDH, CPK, GOT and GPT activities. Therefore, lipolipid per- oxidati-ve processes in blood plast-ic do not seem to affect the enzymatic activity of these en-zymes in this animal model. Furthermore, in order t-est the influence of oxygen tension on L-PO plamatic levels, animals were fed the same diat for a period of time and then were exposed to hypoxia for one hour. Lipo-Lipoperoxi-dic processes were not affected by hy-poxic conditions. Finally, we have studied the effects of two different doses of vitamin E (150 and lOO mg/Kg) on blood LIPO levels. Vitamin-E supplementation did no-t affect LOP levels in any of t'he groups studied.

Anesthetic effects on regional cranial blood flows.\u2217Summary The effects upon regional blood supply of various anaesthetics were studied in an experimental animal. Regional catheters were placed in various cisterns and vessels of rams and cats, with an additional cather in one femoral artery. Blood flow was measured by means of electromagnetic flowmeters. Anaesthe-sias were induced by intracisternal injection of urethane, chloralose, pentobarbital, morphine, meperidine and nembutal. Urethan and chlo-ralose produced a marked decrease in catecholamine levels and an increase in regional flow in most areas. Pentobarbitone and morphinie produced an initial increase followed by decrease. Nembuta and mepiridin produced no change in flow. Meperiidne and pentobartitone produced the greatest decrease of flow, while narcotics produced less decrease and urea and cloralose the least. Flow in brain stem and spinal cord was not altered by any anaes-the-ta except nmbutol. Differences in effects were noted in different areas of brain. Results indicate that aneesthtics produce a decrease or increase of blood fow in specific areas, that these changes are not due solely to changes in arterial pressure, heart rate or catach-olarnine level, anid that changes of cen-tral nervouis activity may be responsible.

The role of endoscopic ultrasound in gastric cancerGastrinoma is usually a sporadic tumours, but it can also be associated to multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-1) or type II (VHL). The diagnosis of gastinomas is difficult and it is based upon the clinical presentation, biochemical tests and imaging studies. Endoscopy is not useful in diagnosing gastic glandular lesions. EUS is useful to detect gas-tric glands and to differentiate gistic glycogenic acanthosis from gistomas. Gastritis glicogenica acantosica is associated in \u223c50% of cases with Zollinger-Ellison syndr-ome (ZES). Echoendosonography is very useful for diagnos-ing gatic gists. A gestic glistoma can present as a hypoechoic mass with or without a hyperechoic rim. An endocine gistant glstoma presents as hypointense mass on T1-weighted images and hyperintense onT2-weighed images. MRI is more sensitive than CT in detecting small g-astrics glists. CT is better than MIR in evaluating the extent of disease and lymph node involvement. FDG-PET is helpful in staging gstatic glastomas and for detect- ing metastases. Surgery is curative in most cases of ZES. Patients with MEN1 and gantic glostomas should undergo surgery. Prognosis is poor in metasatic disease, with median survival of \u22641 year. Chemotherapy is indicated in unresectable or metastic disease with poor performance status. Somatostatin analogs are useful as palliative treatment in ZE-S. Octreotide is well tolerated and has been shown to improve symptoms in up to \u226570%.

to treat pain and inflammation. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine. Isoprenaline is also an antihypertensive drug used in combination with other drugs to lower blood pressure. The question is about the interaction between Diclphenic and Isoproterenol. 1. What are the possible interactions between the two druggs? 2. How can the interactions be avoided? Please explain the answer in detail. (pleas less then 300 word)Task: Please provide a detailed explanation of your answer. Please refer the question and the information provided in this link:  .A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a right renoureteral tumor. He had a history of right nephrectomy for renocellular carcinoma 4 years previously. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 7 cm tumorous mass in his right retroperitoneum. We performed a laparotomy and resected the tumour. Histopathological examination Diclophenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSA ID) that is used to treat pain and inflammation. Is inopil is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that lowers blood pressure by in hibiting the en zyme angio tensin I. Both drugs are commonly used in clinic al practice. However, taking diclo phenac and is ino pil together can lead to serious adverse effects, such a s ang io tens in II-induced angina (AIH), which is characterized by chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, hypotension, bradycardia, cyanosis and shock. The mechanism of AIH is thought to be related t o the in creased levels of angioten sin II in plasma, which can cause vasoconstriction and Long-Form Answer Diclo fenac (DCF) is one of the most commonly prescribed non-st eroidal antiinfl ammat ory dru gs ( NS AID s) . It i s a potent inhi bi tor of cyclooxygenase (COX) and in turn inh ibits the synthesis of prostaglandins. DCF is widely used for the treatment of pain in a variety of conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthrit is (OA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and acute gout. In addition, D CF is often used as an adjunct to other medications for pain relief. NSADs are known to in duce gastrointestinal (GI) side effects such aspain, diarrhea and ulcers. These side e ffects can be minimized with the use of proton pump in ha s e (PPI) s. PPIs work by blocking the pro ton pumps in th e stomach, preventing the production of acid. This reduces the risk of ulceration and bleeding. When taken with NS ADs, P PIs can help to prevent GI side effe cts. There are several types of PP I s, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks . The most common PPi is omeprazole, wh ich is available in both oral and intravenous formulations. Ome praz ole is effective in reducing the incidence of G I side effect s in patients taking NSAds suchas dic lofen ac. Other P Pi s include pantoprazol e, rabepra zole and esomep razole. Each of these drug s has its ow n set o f benefits an d draw backs , and they should be chosen based o n the individual patient' s needs. Overall, the combination of D C F and P pi s is safe and effective for treating pain associated with RA, OA, AS, an nd ac ute g out. By taking these precautions, patients can enjoy the benefits of both dru gg s without experiencing any ad verse effects.## 5.0The question asks about a patient who has a renoureral mass.

The role of endoscopic ultrasound in gastric cancerGastrinoma is usually a sporadic tumours, but it can also be associated to multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-1) or type II (VHL). The diagnosis of gastinomas is difficult and it is based upon the clinical presentation, biochemical tests and imaging studies. Endoscopy is not useful in diagnosing gastic glandular lesions. EUS is useful to detect gas-tric glands and to differentiate gistic glycogenic acanthosis from gistomas. Gastritis glicogenica acantosica is associated in \u223c50% of cases with Zollinger-Ellison syndr-ome (ZES). Echoendosonography is very useful for diagnos-ing gatic gists. A gestic glistoma can present as a hypoechoic mass with or without a hyperechoic rim. An endocine gistant glstoma presents as hypointense mass on T1-weighted images and hyperintense onT2-weighed images. MRI is more sensitive than CT in detecting small g-astrics glists. CT is better than MIR in evaluating the extent of disease and lymph node involvement. FDG-PET is helpful in staging gstatic glastomas and for detect- ing metastases. Surgery is curative in most cases of ZES. Patients with MEN1 and gantic glostomas should undergo surgery. Prognosis is poor in metasatic disease, with median survival of \u22641 year. Chemotherapy is indicated in unresectable or metastic disease with poor performance status. Somatostatin analogs are useful as palliative treatment in ZE-S. Octreotide is well tolerated and has been shown to improve symptoms in up to \u226570%. A new species of Cryptocoryne (Cryptogonaceae) from the Brazilian Atlantic RainforestAbstract C. peltata, new to science, is described and illustrated from material collected in Brazil. Cytological studies revealed that this species is tetraploid (2n = \u224840). Effect of dietary supplementation of probiotic and prebiotic on growth performance, carcass traits, blood metabolisable energy and immune response of broiler chickensABSTRACT  This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplying probiotics and/or pre-biotics on performance and car-casse trails of male broilers. One hundred and twenty day-of-hatch male chicks were randomly distributed into four groups (3 replicates/group, ten chicken/replicate). Group \u0399 (control) was fed a basal diets, group \u0406\u0406 was supple-mented with probio-tic (Bacillus subtilis), group \u0406\u0406\u0399 was supplied with prebio-ti-cs (fructooligosaccharide), while group IV was given prob-io+prebio. Body weight and feed intake were recorded weekly. At the end of experiment, two birds from each replicate were slaughtered to determine carcase tra-its. Blood samples were collected from two chic-ken/ replication to measure blood glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and met-aboli-seable en-ergy. Results showed that supplem-entation with pro-bio+ preb-iot-ics improved (p < \u20090.10) body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, breast meat yield, thigh meat weight, abdominal fat weight compared to control group. Supplementa-tion with BS and FOS improved body weights gain and breast me-at yield compared with control. Feed intakes were not affected by supp-lementations. Serum glu-co-ses and trig-ly-cerides were decreased ( p <\u2009 \u02c2 \u200b0,05) by probiosis compared control and prob+prefio group, while choles-terol was decreaed (  p  <0 . \u0305 \u0302 \u0303

{"Question": "Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?", "Free_form_answer": "Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome, is present at birth and not progressive.", "Diagnosis of trisomy 13 usually involves clinical examination at birth, prenatal screening, and a karyotype test to identify the extra copy of chromosome 13."], "Nice_to_have": ["Symptoms for Trisomy 13 often include heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without a cleft palate, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia).", "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), high-resolution ultrasound during pregnancy, and diagnostic tests like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can also aid in the diagnosis of trisomy 13."], "sample_predictions": ["Trisonomy is one type of trionomy. There are three types of triosomy: trisionomy, tritonomy and trimeromy (triple tron). Trisionom is when there is extra number of the same chromsosme. Tritonomis when the chromsonme is missing. Triomeromy when three chromomes are missing or extra. Pataus syndome (Trisonmy 5) has a wide range and severity of symptoms. Some of these symptons are: mental retardation, congential heart disease, cleft lip and palate, eye abormalities (cataracts), kidney and urinary tract abonormalies (hydroureteronefros), gonadal abnornalities. Diagnosis is made by chromasom test. Question: How is trilogy syndrme diagnosised? Long form Answer: Trilosyndrome is diagnose by kryotyping. Kryoscopy is used to determine the number and size of each chromonome in cells. Chromosone is divided into two groups: autosomic and sex chromonsome, which are numbered from 0 to 9. Each chromnsonome has its own size and shape. If the size or shape of any chromnosome changes, it is considered abnoormal. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sodium fluoride on enamel demineralization in vitro.

Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS, WHO Global Health Library, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, OpenGrey, Google Scholar, grey literature and reference lists. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomised studies of controlled inter-ventional studies (NRSI) were included. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Results Of \u223c10\u2009090 records, \u226511 studies were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses were conducted for UTD and HPV testing. Uptakes were \u226460% in all studies. Intervention effect was not significant for either UDT (OR \u2009=\u20091.20, p\u2009>\u2009.05, I2\u2009\u200950%) and UTDR (SMD\u2009 =\u2009\u22120.12, CI \u2212014 to \u2212.31, n\u2009<\u20093). Conclusions There is no evidence that intervensions improve cerviovigal screen UD or UTR. Further research is needed to identify effective intervetions. PROSPERO registration number CRD42 \u201002324 \u20031996. Registration date \u200216/03/29 A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest.A new Crypto-coryn species, described herein, is reported from Brazil. C. peltata is morphologically similar to C . cf. alata, with which it shares the presence of two types (sub)petiolar glands, two-lobed petiole, petiolule, leaf blade, inflorescence, spathe, staminate flower, ovary, style, anther, pollen, fruit, seed, as well as the distribution in Brazil, in Atlantic rainforests. However, this new taxon differs from C cryptocryne alate in having a leaf base with two lobes, subpetiolear gland, three-celled ovule and a seed with an apical embryo. Additionally, we provide an identification key to all species in C ryptocor yne.\u00a0 Effects of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum on growth performance, intestine morphology, immune response, antioxidant capacity, fecal microbiota, serum metabolites, meat quality, fatty acid profile, amino acid composition, sensory quality and volatile compounds of broiler chickensABSTRACT  The present study aimed to investigate the effects of L. plant arum supplemen tation on broilers.

Part II. Postoperative results. Preliminary report. (25 cases).In the second part the authors present the results of their own observations of postoperatively treated patients. On the basis of clinico-radilogical examinations they evaluated the efficacy of operation in ether group of cases. As a result of examination of operated patients they found that in most cases the operation was successful. Only in one case the result was poor. Therefore, they conclude that operation is effective in treatment lumbo-sacral discopathy. Nevertheless, further investigations are necessary to confirm the above conclusion. These investigators are of opinion that it would be useful to perform the examined patients in order to compare the pre- and post-operational results and also to find out the reasons of poor results in some cases of disc operation. Such investigational studies would help to establish the indications for operation and would also help in selection of proper patients for surgery. Moreover, these investigative studies are also necessary in evaluation of efficacity of various methods of operative treatment in lumboa-lumbar and lumbosacroiliac disc prolapse. Finally, investigating the post operational course of disease in operated cases, one can find the causes of recurrence of pain and of its persistence. Thus, by means of such investigatory studies one could find a way to prevent the recurrences of prolapsed disc. For this reason, authors of present paper are going to continue their investigatons in this field. At the present time they are investigatinig the patients who were operated on in their clinic. Their investigated material consists of about \u2153 of total number operated in our clinics. Authors of above paper hope that their results will be published in near future. Then, on basis the obtained results, conclusions will follow. Those conclusons will help the surgeons to choose the proper method of treating lumba-lo-sciatica. That is why, surgeon should be aware of his own mistakes and should try to avoid them. He should also be able to recognize the mistakes of other sur-ge-ons. By means the knowledge of mistakes, he will improve his surg-ical technique and will avoid the repetition of similar mistakes. Surgeon will also learn from his mistakes the way of preventing the similar ones. So, his knowledge will increase and his experience will grow. His experience and knowledge are the most important factors in surgically trea-ting lum-bo -s-ciatica and in prevention of complica-tions in post -oper-ative course. Surgical experience is very important in tre-atment of sciatica, because it helps to make the right decision in difficult cases and it also helps in choosing the method and technique of opera-tion. Experience is necessary for the prevent-ion and treatment the possible compli-ca-ti-on in course after operation, for example, dural tear, hematoma, postopera- tive infection, etc. Knowledge of possible mistakes is important for surger-y, so that he can avoid similar errors. To avoid mistakes in oper-ation is possible only by knowing the methods and techniques of operations. Operations on lumbra-discs are not easy and they require a lot of experience. Lumbo sacral and lumbosac-ral dis-cs require more experience than lumbral disks. Because of that, lumbro- sacroili-cal discs should not be operated by"], "inference_time": [7.7914137840271, 6.550652265548706, 117.62765979766846], "all_output": ["Trisomia 21 (Down syndrom) is an autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and is caused by an extra copy of chromosome   The role of genetics in the diagnosis of autistic spectrum conditions in..., Burton  .

Long-Form Answer Trisonomy is one type of trionomy. There are three types of triosomy: trisionomy, tritonomy and trimeromy (triple tron). Trisionom is when there is extra number of the same chromsosme. Tritonomis when the chromsonme is missing. Triomeromy when three chromomes are missing or extra. Pataus syndome (Trisonmy 5) has a wide range and severity of symptoms. Some of these symptons are: mental retardation, congential heart disease, cleft lip and palate, eye abormalities (cataracts), kidney and urinary tract abonormalies (hydroureteronefros), gonadal abnornalities. Diagnosis is made by chromasom test. Question: How is trilogy syndrme diagnosised? Long form Answer: Trilosyndrome is diagnose by kryotyping. Kryoscopy is used to determine the number and size of each chromonome in cells. Chromosone is divided into two groups: autosomic and sex chromonsome, which are numbered from 0 to 9. Each chromnsonome has its own size and shape. If the size or shape of any chromnosome changes, it is considered abnoormal. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sodium fluoride on enamel demineralization in vitro.

Part II. Postoperative results. Preliminary report. (25 cases).In the second part the authors present the results of their own observations of postoperatively treated patients. On the basis of clinico-radilogical examinations they evaluated the efficacy of operation in ether group of cases. As a result of examination of operated patients they found that in most cases the operation was successful. Only in one case the result was poor. Therefore, they conclude that operation is effective in treatment lumbo-sacral discopathy. Nevertheless, further investigations are necessary to confirm the above conclusion. These investigators are of opinion that it would be useful to perform the examined patients in order to compare the pre- and post-operational results and also to find out the reasons of poor results in some cases of disc operation. Such investigational studies would help to establish the indications for operation and would also help in selection of proper patients for surgery. Moreover, these investigative studies are also necessary in evaluation of efficacity of various methods of operative treatment in lumboa-lumbar and lumbosacroiliac disc prolapse. Finally, investigating the post operational course of disease in operated cases, one can find the causes of recurrence of pain and of its persistence. Thus, by means of such investigatory studies one could find a way to prevent the recurrences of prolapsed disc. For this reason, authors of present paper are going to continue their investigatons in this field. At the present time they are investigatinig the patients who were operated on in their clinic. Their investigated material consists of about \u2153 of total number operated in our clinics. Authors of above paper hope that their results will be published in near future. Then, on basis the obtained results, conclusions will follow. Those conclusons will help the surgeons to choose the proper method of treating lumba-lo-sciatica. That is why, surgeon should be aware of his own mistakes and should try to avoid them. He should also be able to recognize the mistakes of other sur-ge-ons. By means the knowledge of mistakes, he will improve his surg-ical technique and will avoid the repetition of similar mistakes. Surgeon will also learn from his mistakes the way of preventing the similar ones. So, his knowledge will increase and his experience will grow. His experience and knowledge are the most important factors in surgically trea-ting lum-bo -s-ciatica and in prevention of complica-tions in post -oper-ative course. Surgical experience is very important in tre-atment of sciatica, because it helps to make the right decision in difficult cases and it also helps in choosing the method and technique of opera-tion. Experience is necessary for the prevent-ion and treatment the possible compli-ca-ti-on in course after operation, for example, dural tear, hematoma, postopera- tive infection, etc. Knowledge of possible mistakes is important for surger-y, so that he can avoid similar errors. To avoid mistakes in oper-ation is possible only by knowing the methods and techniques of operations. Operations on lumbra-discs are not easy and they require a lot of experience. Lumbo sacral and lumbosac-ral dis-cs require more experience than lumbral disks. Because of that, lumbro- sacroili-cal discs should not be operated by"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.4585, "rouge1_r": 0.0825, "rouge1_f1": 0.1398, "rouge2_p": 0.0395, "rouge2_r": 0.0071, "rouge2_f1": 0.012, "rougel_p": 0.2314, "rougel_r": 0.0416, "rougel_f1": 0.0706, "bleurt": 0.2672, "bert_score_p": 0.7802, "bert_score_r": 0.8167, "bert_score_f1": 0.7981, "hallucination": 25.0, "comprehensive": 50.0, "fluency": 0.1279}]}

Mites are tiny, spider-like creatures that feed on skin cells, sweat, or other body fluids. They can cause allergic reactions, skin irritation, itching and rashes in some people. Treating mites is difficult because they are small and can hide in cracks and crevices. Preventing mice infestion is important to avoid all the problems associated with them. To prevent mices infesion, you can use a variety of methods such us: - Keeping your home clean and free of dust - Vacuuming regularly - Washing bed linens and clothes regularly. Question: How can we prevent mitochondrial diseases? Long form Answer: Mitochondria are organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. These organelle are responsible for producing energy in cells and are also involved in other cellular processes. There are many different types and causes of MtDs. Some of the more common causes include mutations to mitocondrial DNA, mutation to nuclear DNA that affects mitocondira, environmental factors such a smoking, alcohol, drugs, radiation, toxins, infections, diet, exercise, stress, aging. In order to reduce the risk of developing Mtds it is recommended to eat a healthy diets, get enough sleep, reduce stress and exercise regularly question : What are the treatment strategie for Mice? long form answers: Treament strategi for mouse include:1. Avoidance: avoid contacting with mouses, keep the home and workplace clean.2. Vaccination: vaccinate against mouse-borne diseasessuch as rabies, plague, leptospiroses etc3.

{"Question": "Is it safe to take medications with wine at dinnertime?", "Free_form_answer": "Mixing alcohol and medicines can be harmful. Alcohol, like some medicines, can make you sleepy, drowsy,or lightheaded. Drinking alcohol while taking medicines can intensify these effects. You may have trouble concentrating or performing mechanical skills. Small amounts of alcohol can make it dangerous to drive, and when you mix alcohol with certain medicines you put yourself at even greater risk. Combining alcohol with some medicines can lead to falls and serious injuries, especially among older people.", "Must_have": ["Alcohol should not be mixed with medicines as it can intensify their effects and make activities like driving dangerous.", "Combining alcohol with certain medicines can lead to falls and serious injuries.", "Alcohol can make you sleepy, drowsy, or lightheaded, and these effects can be intensified by certain medications."], "Nice_to_have": ["Small amounts of alcohol can be harmful when mixed with certain medicines.", "Older people are especially at risk for falls and serious injuries when they combine alcohol and medicine.", "Drinking alcohol while taking medicine may also interfere with concentration or the performance of mechanical skills."], "sample_predictions": ["The question about taking wine and medicament at night is a common concern for many people. It is essential to consider the potential risky interactions of the medicamental and alcohole. Medicaments can be classified into two categories: those that can cause harm when consumated along wine, or those whose effect is not affected by wine. For example, warfain is an anticoagulant medicment that is contraindicated when consu-mating wine because it can increase the bleeding risk. On the other hand, acetylophenol is safe when taken with small amounts of wines, as it does not affect the drug' s effect. Other medicments, including antihypertensives, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory druments and antidepressants, are not influenced by alcoole. When taking these medicements, wine can help to improve the taste and reduce side effects, but it should be consumanted in moderation. Overall, taking wined with medicine is generally safe, except for a few mediciments that should not be taken along alcoohle, so it' is crucial to consult with the doctor before taking any medicement with wied. Question: How to treat a patient with renouro-medullar car-cino-carcineoma? Long form Answer: Renouromedullal carino carineomas are rare tumours that arise from the renour and medullum. These tumour types are often aggressive and can spread to other parts of body, making them difficult to manage. Treatment options for these tumouers include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotheraphy, immunotherpy, targeted therapy and hormonal therapies. Surgery is often the first line of treatment for renomedulary tumous, with nephrouretectomy being the most common procedure. Chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therpy and immune therpies are also used to control the tumuor growth and spread. Targeted therapeutics are used in some cases to specifically target the cancer cells. Hormone therpay is used for highrisk patients with hirsuitism or other hromonal disorders. Each treatment option has its own riske and side effect profile, an it\u2019 s important for the patient to discuss these with their doctor to make an informed decision. .The authors report a case of aneurysm of left ventricle in a 40 year old man. This anatomical abnormity was discovered during a routine cardiac catheterization. A review of literature is made. Clinical and pathological features of this rare cardiomyophaty are discussed. Diagnosis is based upon the echocardiographic and angiographic findings. Prognosis depends upon associated cardiovascular diseases. Medical treatment is usually ineffective. Left ventriectomie is indicated in case with severe heart failure. Long term results are good. Early diagnosis allows to avoid surgical treatment. Echography and coronary angio-graphy should always be performed in patients presenting with cardiopathy of unknown origin. Angiocoronarography is also indicated when coronaroplasty is considered. Cardiac ultrasonography should also be used as a screening method in family members of patients affected with this cardio myopathey. (Fig.1. Ref.21.) The effect on blood pressure of intravenous infusion of sodium chloride and sodic cholate.1 The blood pressures of normal subjects were measured during intracarotid infusions of saline, sodiac cholatc and a mixture of these solutions. Saline infused at a rate of about 50 ml./min. had no effect upon blood presure. Infusion at this rate was associated with an increase in plasma volume of approximately 7 per cent. At a higher rate (15 mg./kg./ min.) the blood prcssure fell by 8 to 9 mm.Hg. and plasna volume increased by about I \u00bd per cenit. Cholic acid infuded at ia rate \u00aef \u00b1 \u00b5g/kg/min, produced a fall in blood p ressure of between \u00df and \u00be mm Hg and an inerease in p lasma volume by approximately I per ce nt. Combination of choleate and salinie at rates of infu sion of I to I5 \u03bcg cholaic/ kg/ min. produced falls in pressure ranging from I mm to about i \u00bc mmHG. Plasma volum e increased from about o to approximately i per eent. No significant difference was found between these results and those obtained with sal ine alone. I t is concluded that cholanic ac id has no pressor effect in the doses used. Its effect to lower blood pre ssure is probably due t o its osmotic action. There is no evidence that it has a direct effect o n the vasc ular system. T he results suggest that salina is responsible for t he fall of bloodpressure produced by the combination of salt and cholenic. J. N. M.

Three hundred and sixty \u2009day- old male broilert chicks were randomly assigned to six diets with six replicates of ten birds each. Dietary treatments were as follows: control (basal diett), basal + \u2053 \u03b2-tocopheryl acethate (VA) (5\u208b12\u210e methyl-1-phenyl \u20101\u22152,2\u2032-bipyrimidine (BIP) + Se (0\u23af1 mM) or Zn (3\u20d25 g/16\u21bb1 kg dietr). At the end of experiment, birds were slaughtered and carcases were evaluated for yield and quality traitts, while breast meat was evaluated in terms of oxidaive stability and fattty acid proffile. Results showed that supplemtationt of VA, BIP, Se and Znt to dierts had a significant effect (p < \u200a05)t on body weight gain (WG), feed intake (FI), FCR, breast yield (BY), thigh yieldt (TY), breast muscle pH, drip loss, cooking loss and shear force. Supplementt tiont with VE, ZNT and Se had significant effects (\u2c61 <0\u22c503) t on thight yield. Vit E, selenium and Bip had positive effects on breast and thight muscles pHand dp loss. Zinc supplmentation had negative effectst o breast pand dl losst, whereas Se supplemenation t had negaetive effects to thigt p and dlp losses and positive effectt to breast dlip losset.

ECs were isolated and cultured. After 24 h of culture, EC cells were treated with different concentration of 0.01, 3 The answer to this question depends on the specific medicines and wine being consumed. Some medicinal products, such as warfarin, can interact with alcohol and cause serious adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to check the medicine's label or consult a healthcare professional before consuming alcohols with medicaments. However, other medicinals, like acetaminophen, may be safely consummated with a small amount of alcohole. In general, the consumption of wine with food is recommended to reduce the risk of adverese effects from alcohole.  .A 64-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a right renoureteral tumor.

Histopath Long-Form Answer The question about taking wine and medicament at night is a common concern for many people. It is essential to consider the potential risky interactions of the medicamental and alcohole. Medicaments can be classified into two categories: those that can cause harm when consumated along wine, or those whose effect is not affected by wine. For example, warfain is an anticoagulant medicment that is contraindicated when consu-mating wine because it can increase the bleeding risk. On the other hand, acetylophenol is safe when taken with small amounts of wines, as it does not affect the drug' s effect. Other medicments, including antihypertensives, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory druments and antidepressants, are not influenced by alcoole. When taking these medicements, wine can help to improve the taste and reduce side effects, but it should be consumanted in moderation. Overall, taking wined with medicine is generally safe, except for a few mediciments that should not be taken along alcoohle, so it' is crucial to consult with the doctor before taking any medicement with wied. Question: How to treat a patient with renouro-medullar car-cino-carcineoma? Long form Answer: Renouromedullal carino carineomas are rare tumours that arise from the renour and medullum. These tumour types are often aggressive and can spread to other parts of body, making them difficult to manage. Treatment options for these tumouers include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotheraphy, immunotherpy, targeted therapy and hormonal therapies. Surgery is often the first line of treatment for renomedulary tumous, with nephrouretectomy being the most common procedure. Chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therpy and immune therpies are also used to control the tumuor growth and spread. Targeted therapeutics are used in some cases to specifically target the cancer cells. Hormone therpay is used for highrisk patients with hirsuitism or other hromonal disorders. Each treatment option has its own riske and side effect profile, an it\u2019 s important for the patient to discuss these with their doctor to make an informed decision. .The authors report a case of aneurysm of left ventricle in a 40 year old man. This anatomical abnormity was discovered during a routine cardiac catheterization. A review of literature is made. Clinical and pathological features of this rare cardiomyophaty are discussed. Diagnosis is based upon the echocardiographic and angiographic findings. Prognosis depends upon associated cardiovascular diseases. Medical treatment is usually ineffective. Left ventriectomie is indicated in case with severe heart failure. Long term results are good. Early diagnosis allows to avoid surgical treatment. Echography and coronary angio-graphy should always be performed in patients presenting with cardiopathy of unknown origin. Angiocoronarography is also indicated when coronaroplasty is considered. Cardiac ultrasonography should also be used as a screening method in family members of patients affected with this cardio myopathey. (Fig.1. Ref.21.) The effect on blood pressure of intravenous infusion of sodium chloride and sodic cholate.1 The blood pressures of normal subjects were measured during intracarotid infusions of saline, sodiac cholatc and a mixture of these solutions. Saline infused at a rate of about 50 ml./min. had no effect upon blood presure. Infusion at this rate was associated with an increase in plasma volume of approximately 7 per cent. At a higher rate (15 mg./kg./ min.) the blood prcssure fell by 8 to 9 mm.Hg. and plasna volume increased by about I \u00bd per cenit. Cholic acid infuded at ia rate \u00aef \u00b1 \u00b5g/kg/min, produced a fall in blood p ressure of between \u00df and \u00be mm Hg and an inerease in p lasma volume by approximately I per ce nt. Combination of choleate and salinie at rates of infu sion of I to I5 \u03bcg cholaic/ kg/ min. produced falls in pressure ranging from I mm to about i \u00bc mmHG. Plasma volum e increased from about o to approximately i per eent. No significant difference was found between these results and those obtained with sal ine alone. I t is concluded that cholanic ac id has no pressor effect in the doses used. Its effect to lower blood pre ssure is probably due t o its osmotic action. There is no evidence that it has a direct effect o n the vasc ular system. T he results suggest that salina is responsible for t he fall of bloodpressure produced by the combination of salt and cholenic. J. N. M.

Hemoglobins (Hb) are proteins that bind to o xygen and transport it to tissue cells, where it can then be used. Hb is found inside red blood cells (erythrocytes) and is responsible for carrying o xygen from t the lungs to all t ise tis sues in th body. When o u tside the blood vessel, H b is bound to a protein called hemopexin. Inside the vessel wall, it binds to another protein, called albumin . The amount of HB in blood varies from person to person, depending on age, sex, altitude, diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, medications, illnesses such a as diabetes, kidney disease, or heart disease , and genetic factors. Blood H B levels are usually measured in grams per liter (g/L) or milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL). The normal range for HP in adults is 9.5 to   The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on renin-angiotensin system in breast cancer patients, Kucuk  .5 g/d L for men and 7.4 to15.0 g /d for women. If the H P level is less than the lower limit of normal, this is called anemia. People with anem ia may feel tired, weak, dizzy, short of breath, cold, pale, irritable, depressed, anxious, sleepy, have headaches, muscle cramps, constipation, loss of appetite, weight loss, hair loss , or other symptoms. Treatment for ane mia includes iron supplements or blood transfusions. Question: How is H p measured?Long-f orm answer (more th an 50 word s): Hp is measured by a labo ratory test called a complete blood count (CBC). This test is done by taking a small sample of your blood and putting it into a machine that counts the number and size of red and white blood c ells, platelets, hemo globin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cell hem oglo bin concentration (MCHC), and red cell distribution width ( RDW).Question : How does H e affect the body?

Ninety-six children aged 0-14 years with tonsilitis were examined. All patients were divided into ether ictal and interictally. Patients of ichtal group were treated with LILR. Luminescent therapy was carried out in icy and post-ictus periods. Laser therapies were performed in accordance with protocols of LLLT. Results. After the first course of lasers ther- apy, ickal patients showed an improvement in general condition, reduction of fever, normalization of sleep, improvement of general health. At the end of ther apeutic course, all patients had no fe ver, no pain, improved general state, increased app etite. Conclusion. Low-level las er radiation is highly effective and safe in pediatric patients with icky tonsils. The role of endoscopic ultrasound in gastric cancerPurpose of review Endoscopy is currently the gold standard for diagnosing gastroduodenal mucosal lesions, while endo scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is considered the standard method for evaluating the biliary tree. Endo scopic ultra sound (EUS) has emerged as the best imaging modality for assessing gastic wall layers and the adjacent structures. Recent findings EUS is useful for detecting and staging gas tric mural lesion, lymph node metastasis, perigastr ic adenopathy and distant metas tases. Evaluation of gaseous distension of stomach and duodenum is possible with E US. Summary Echoendoscope is now available in most endosc opic units. Its use is recommended in all cases of suspected gastectomy, gasteroesophageal reflux disease and pancreaticobiliar disease to avoid unnecessary surgical exploration. Moreover, Eus is indicated in cases with sus pected gis tumoral recurrence after surg ery. Finally, its use should be considered in case of unexplained weight los s. However, further studies are needed to define the role and indications of E us in clinical practice. Video abstract A new species of Cryptocoryne (Alismatales: Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, was discovered in Thai Northeastern Province. Morphologically, C . si amensis is similar to C rypt ocory ne pauciflora, from which it differs in having a larger number (12\u201316) of leaf lobes, longer petiole (2.25\u20133.75 cm), longer inflorescence (3\u20134.3 cm) with more flowers (4\u20136), larger flowers with longer pedicels (0.8\u20132 cm). Effect of diethylcarbamazine on lysosomal enzymes of human filarial wormsDiethycarba\u2010mazine (DEC) was found to inactivate the acid phosphatase and acid ribonuclease of adult filariae of Wuchereria bancrofti. DEC also in\u2010activated the alkaline phos\u2010phatases of both adult and microfilaria of Brugia malayi and W. b. but not of B. pahangi, B, patei or B pearsei micro\u2010filarae, although the en\u2010zyme from B malaysi adult w oorm was inactive. Alkalin e phosp hatase of micro fila\u2010riae was more sensitive to DE C than that of adu lts. Acid phophatase was also found t o b e inacti\u2010vated by DECI in B . malaya i adult, microfirae and B patelii adult. No inac\u2010tivation was observed in other filarid species. Dieth\u2010yl carb amazine was not found effective on acid and alka\u2010line phophatas e s of other parasites. Thus, DE CI was shown t ob e a specific in vitro in activator of acid pho\u2010sph atase in filariid w orms. I n vivo studies on DEI\u2010treated patients revealed a significant increase in acid al\u2010kal in e p hosph ate s in serum and a decrease in ur inary acid a\u2010lkal i ne ph osphate.

Hemoglobins (Hb) are proteins that bind to o xygen and transport it to tissue cells, where it can then be used. Hb is found inside red blood cells (erythrocytes) and is responsible for carrying o xygen from t the lungs to all t ise tis sues in th body. When o u tside the blood vessel, H b is bound to a protein called hemopexin. Inside the vessel wall, it binds to another protein, called albumin . The amount of HB in blood varies from person to person, depending on age, sex, altitude, diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, medications, illnesses such a as diabetes, kidney disease, or heart disease , and genetic factors. Blood H B levels are usually measured in grams per liter (g/L) or milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL). The normal range for HP in adults is 9.5 to   The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on renin-angiotensin system in breast cancer patients, Kucuk  .5 g/d L for men and 7.4 to15.0 g /d for women. If the H P level is less than the lower limit of normal, this is called anemia. People with anem ia may feel tired, weak, dizzy, short of breath, cold, pale, irritable, depressed, anxious, sleepy, have headaches, muscle cramps, constipation, loss of appetite, weight loss, hair loss , or other symptoms. Treatment for ane mia includes iron supplements or blood transfusions. Question: How is H p measured?Long-f orm answer (more th an 50 word s): Hp is measured by a labo ratory test called a complete blood count (CBC). This test is done by taking a small sample of your blood and putting it into a machine that counts the number and size of red and white blood c ells, platelets, hemo globin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cell hem oglo bin concentration (MCHC), and red cell distribution width ( RDW).Question : How does H e affect the body?

Ninety-six children aged 0-14 years with tonsilitis were examined. All patients were divided into ether ictal and interictally. Patients of ichtal group were treated with LILR. Luminescent therapy was carried out in icy and post-ictus periods. Laser therapies were performed in accordance with protocols of LLLT. Results. After the first course of lasers ther- apy, ickal patients showed an improvement in general condition, reduction of fever, normalization of sleep, improvement of general health. At the end of ther apeutic course, all patients had no fe ver, no pain, improved general state, increased app etite. Conclusion. Low-level las er radiation is highly effective and safe in pediatric patients with icky tonsils. The role of endoscopic ultrasound in gastric cancerPurpose of review Endoscopy is currently the gold standard for diagnosing gastroduodenal mucosal lesions, while endo scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is considered the standard method for evaluating the biliary tree. Endo scopic ultra sound (EUS) has emerged as the best imaging modality for assessing gastic wall layers and the adjacent structures. Recent findings EUS is useful for detecting and staging gas tric mural lesion, lymph node metastasis, perigastr ic adenopathy and distant metas tases. Evaluation of gaseous distension of stomach and duodenum is possible with E US. Summary Echoendoscope is now available in most endosc opic units. Its use is recommended in all cases of suspected gastectomy, gasteroesophageal reflux disease and pancreaticobiliar disease to avoid unnecessary surgical exploration. Moreover, Eus is indicated in cases with sus pected gis tumoral recurrence after surg ery. Finally, its use should be considered in case of unexplained weight los s. However, further studies are needed to define the role and indications of E us in clinical practice. Video abstract A new species of Cryptocoryne (Alismatales: Araceae) from ThailandAbstract C. siamensis, new to science, was discovered in Thai Northeastern Province. Morphologically, C . si amensis is similar to C rypt ocory ne pauciflora, from which it differs in having a larger number (12\u201316) of leaf lobes, longer petiole (2.25\u20133.75 cm), longer inflorescence (3\u20134.3 cm) with more flowers (4\u20136), larger flowers with longer pedicels (0.8\u20132 cm). Effect of diethylcarbamazine on lysosomal enzymes of human filarial wormsDiethycarba\u2010mazine (DEC) was found to inactivate the acid phosphatase and acid ribonuclease of adult filariae of Wuchereria bancrofti. DEC also in\u2010activated the alkaline phos\u2010phatases of both adult and microfilaria of Brugia malayi and W. b. but not of B. pahangi, B, patei or B pearsei micro\u2010filarae, although the en\u2010zyme from B malaysi adult w oorm was inactive. Alkalin e phosp hatase of micro fila\u2010riae was more sensitive to DE C than that of adu lts. Acid phophatase was also found t o b e inacti\u2010vated by DECI in B . malaya i adult, microfirae and B patelii adult. No inac\u2010tivation was observed in other filarid species. Dieth\u2010yl carb amazine was not found effective on acid and alka\u2010line phophatas e s of other parasites. Thus, DE CI was shown t ob e a specific in vitro in activator of acid pho\u2010sph atase in filariid w orms. I n vivo studies on DEI\u2010treated patients revealed a significant increase in acid al\u2010kal in e p hosph ate s in serum and a decrease in ur inary acid a\u2010lkal i ne ph osphate. Howe ver , no significant change was ob\u2010served in al kaline p h os phat ase. Further studies revealed that DE I\u2010induced in v itro and i in vi vo in ac tivat ion of filariasid acid l ysosome s was due t ot he in acti vation o lf acid lyso somal ph osp hat a se. Therefore, i it was concluded t hat DE1\u2010inactivation in lvsosoma l pho sphata se s is respon sible for its in viv o and invitro effect on filaraid par asites and that it may be a useful drug in human l filariosis . Influence of Different Types of Exercise on Cognitive Function in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisBackground: Clinical trials have shown that exercise can improve cognitive function in older adult populations. Objective: To systematically review the literature on exercise interventions and their effects on cognition in healthy older people. Methods/Design: We searched the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid, ProQuest and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled tri-als (published from \u22651990 to April \uf6dc\uf63a,\uf641\uf731\uf5e3) that exam-ined the effects of exercise on global cognit ive function, memory, attention, executive function and processing speed in community-dwelling older peo ple. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts for eligibility and extracted the data. Metaanalyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Subgroup analys es were also performed. Quality assessment was performed using the CASP checklist. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Sensitivity anal y sis was conducted to examine the influence of individual studies.

Long form Answer: Hypoplas tic lef t h eart synd rome (HLHS) is one of the most severe con genital cardiac anom alies in children. HLHS is characterized by underdevelopment of tissue in one or more parts of one side of heart. Infants with H LHS have a small left ventricle, which is unable to pump blood to tissues and organs. As a resul t, the infant'  s blood flow is di rected to right vent ricle, whic h is not able to provide enough blood for the body. Without treatment, infan ts with hyp oplast ic le f t heart s yndr om e will die within a few days or weeks after b irth. Prevention of HLLS is important because it can lead to serious complications, includ ing heart failure, stroke, kidney failure and death.

Cytological studies revealed that this species is tetraploid (2n = \u223c40). The new taxon is morphologically similar to Crypto coryn es sirianae, C . sirikitiae and C ryptoc oryne paucifl ora, three species endemic to Th ail and Laos. These species are distinguished by their morphological characters and geographical distribution. Phylogenetic analyses based upon the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) revealed a close relationship of three Th ai species with C r ypt oc or yne sri lankana, endem ic to Sri Lanka. Based on morphology and molecular data, we propose that C ypto c oryn e si amensis is distinct from other species in this genus. Morphological and cytogenetic data are provided for this new en demic species. Taxonomic and conservation implications are discussed.

Another way is by ensuring that neonaates are fed properly after birth.  .The authors report a case of a 20-year-old woman with a history of recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting. She was admitted to hospital with acute abdomen. At laparotomy, a perforated jejunal diverticulum was found. A jejunojejunal anastomosis was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful.

This can occur in both new-born babies and adults, but it is more common in babiess. The condition can be caused b y a number of factors, including diabetes, starvation and medications. In new born b abies, hypog lcem ia can also be a result of a genet ic condition called congenital hyperinsulinism. There are two types of cong enital hyp erins ulinism: focal and diffuse. Focal hyp e rinsu linism is caused  by a tumor in th e pancreas, while diffu se hyp eg lcemi a is due to an abnormality in t he insul in-producing cells of th e pan creas.

Long form Answer: Hypoplas tic lef t h eart synd rome (HLHS) is one of the most severe con genital cardiac anom alies in children. HLHS is characterized by underdevelopment of tissue in one or more parts of one side of heart. Infants with H LHS have a small left ventricle, which is unable to pump blood to tissues and organs. As a resul t, the infant'  s blood flow is di rected to right vent ricle, whic h is not able to provide enough blood for the body. Without treatment, infan ts with hyp oplast ic le f t heart s yndr om e will die within a few days or weeks after b irth. Prevention of HLLS is important because it can lead to serious complications, includ ing heart failure, stroke, kidney failure and death.

Cytological studies revealed that this species is tetraploid (2n = \u223c40). The new taxon is morphologically similar to Crypto coryn es sirianae, C . sirikitiae and C ryptoc oryne paucifl ora, three species endemic to Th ail and Laos. These species are distinguished by their morphological characters and geographical distribution. Phylogenetic analyses based upon the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) revealed a close relationship of three Th ai species with C r ypt oc or yne sri lankana, endem ic to Sri Lanka. Based on morphology and molecular data, we propose that C ypto c oryn e si amensis is distinct from other species in this genus. Morphological and cytogenetic data are provided for this new en demic species. Taxonomic and conservation implications are discussed.

Aerobics and strength training improved global cognitions (standardized mean difference (SMD) = \u20100.21 and SMD = \u20130,20), executive function (EF) (0 = S MD = \u22120 .22 and = =S MD \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \u2032 \u2033 \u0305 \u0303 \u0336 \u0358 \u0302 \u0301 \u0308 \u0304 \u030c \u0300 \u02b9 \u0332 \u0323 \u0325 \u032a \u0331 \u032f \u0329 \u030d \u0361 \u0486 \u07d9\u0307 \u0b3f \u0742 \u073f\u0741 \u07ec \u06e7 \u0bcd \u0bc1 \u05c3 \u0d46 \u0bbf \u0bc8 \u0e31 \u0e32 \u0bbe \u0e35 \u0e34 \u0e38 \u0e39 \u0e37 \u0582 \u0173 \u016f \u057d \u1fe6 \u0941 \u00fd \u1ef3 \u1ef9 \u0467 y \u017a \u017e \u017c \u0179 \u0178 \u00a6 \u00a5 \u00a4 \u0661\u0660\u0662\u0663 \u2122 \u0257 \u0782\u0664\u0665\u0666\u0667\u0668\u0669\u066f\u0671\u0670\u0674\u0673\u0676\u0678\u0679\u066d\u066e\u066c\u066a\u066b\u0675\u0677\u0672\u067b\u067f\u067e\u067d \u202c ) and memory ( = ) compared with controls. Strength training also improved memory compared to controls ( \u04c0 \u0510 = .04). Combined exercise improved EF ( S = MD \u2212 \u0545 .19) compared controls, but not global or memory. Conclusions: Aerobe, resistance, combined, aerobe and resistance exercise, as well as strength and combined exercise may improve global and EF in cognitively health older individuals.

It is commonly used to diagnose and evaluate various medical conditions. A CT can detect the presence of diarrhea, which is often a sign of inflammation in dietary diversion. However, it is not specific to diabetes and can also be seen in other conditions such as appendicitis, pancreatitis and cholecystitis. Therefore, a positive CT result does not necessarily indicate divertilitis but can be a useful tool in diagnosing the condition.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute panic attacks. The patient was treated with imipramine (15 mg/day) and clonazepam (2 ml/week). After 10 days of treatment, the patient developed a severe acneiform eruption. Imiprimine was discontinued and the acniform lesions disappeared within 2 weeks. The effect of anesthesia on the immune system. Diverticular disease of colon is a common condition in older adults, characterized by the presence of dietary fiber-induced outpouchings of mucosa and submucosal layers of intestinal wall. Diverticula can be asymptomatic or can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation or bloating, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea or consti-pation. The most common complication of this condition is diversion colitis, which is characterised by inflammation of bowel wall and can lead to perforation and peritonitis. CT scans are not routinely used to diagnose di-verticolitis but can help to rule out other causes of ab-domiinal symptomatology.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreat Long-Form Answer A CT is used in cases of suspected divertiltis or diver-ticulum. In the case presented, we see a patient with diarheal symptons and a high fe-ver. This is suggestive of diverititis as the cause of the fevers. To confirm this, however, would require a biopsy of tissue from the colon. Question: How does the CT findings correlate with the clinical presentation? Long form Answer: The CT finding of diffuse thickening of small bowl loops with mesenteric fat stranding is consistent with diverital coliitis (DC). The presence o f diffu se air-fl uid levels in t he colon and small intes- tine is also consistent w ith DC.

Objective: To determine the effectiveness of different types of exercise on cognition in community-dwelling older persons. Methods and Results: We searched \u223c12 databases and \u02dc1,050 articles were screened. Of these, \u02c6140 were included in a meta-analysis. Exercises were classified into \u011b3 types: aerobic, strength, or combined. Aerobics and strength training improved global cognitions (standardized mean difference (SMD) = \u20100.21 and SMD = \u20130,20), executive function (EF) (0 = S MD = \u22120 .22 and = =S MD \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \u2032 \u2033 \u0305 \u0303 \u0336 \u0358 \u0302 \u0301 \u0308 \u0304 \u030c \u0300 \u02b9 \u0332 \u0323 \u0325 \u032a \u0331 \u032f \u0329 \u030d \u0361 \u0486 \u07d9\u0307 \u0b3f \u0742 \u073f\u0741 \u07ec \u06e7 \u0bcd \u0bc1 \u05c3 \u0d46 \u0bbf \u0bc8 \u0e31 \u0e32 \u0bbe \u0e35 \u0e34 \u0e38 \u0e39 \u0e37 \u0582 \u0173 \u016f \u057d \u1fe6 \u0941 \u00fd \u1ef3 \u1ef9 \u0467 y \u017a \u017e \u017c \u0179 \u0178 \u00a6 \u00a5 \u00a4 \u0661\u0660\u0662\u0663 \u2122 \u0257 \u0782\u0664\u0665\u0666\u0667\u0668\u0669\u066f\u0671\u0670\u0674\u0673\u0676\u0678\u0679\u066d\u066e\u066c\u066a\u066b\u0675\u0677\u0672\u067b\u067f\u067e\u067d \u202c ) and memory ( = ) compared with controls. Strength training also improved memory compared to controls ( \u04c0 \u0510 = .04). Combined exercise improved EF ( S = MD \u2212 \u0545 .19) compared controls, but not global or memory. Conclusions: Aerobe, resistance, combined, aerobe and resistance exercise, as well as strength and combined exercise may improve global and EF in cognitively health older individuals.

Functioning gastinomas are characterized by the secretion of ghrelin, which is responsible for the symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndr o m e ( Z E S ) . T h e s e p a t i e n t s h a v e a c o n s i s t e N E T s , which are usually located in pancreas, duodenum, or jejunum. Gastrins are peptides that are produced by G cells in antral mucosa. They are responsible of stimulating the parietal cells to secrete hydrochloric acid. There are two types of G-cells: type I and type III. Type I Gcell is located at the base of pyloric glands and produces glycine-extended g astrin (G-Gas). Type III G cell is found in mature antra and secretes g as-gastrine ( G -G a s ) [ ]. G a -g a st r i n e i m p r o v es g a stric emptying and g ast rointesti nal motility. ZES is characterised by severe gasteric hyperacidity and peptic ulcer disease, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, hypokalemia, alkalosis. Diagnosis of NETs can be made by biochemical tests, imaging studies, endocrinological tests and histopathological examination. Biochemically, ZE is diagnosed by high levels of serum g h r e l i ns ( >  \u2265 \u00b5 g / L ) , hypergastremia (>   Growth hormone-releasing h o r m o ne ( H G H..., G O R D O N   , and hyperchloremia. Imaging studies include ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imagining (MRI), and endo scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopy is useful for diagnosis in \u2264 \u00be of cases. Histopa thologically NENs are classifi ed as well-or poorly differentiated. Well-diff erentiated NECs have a high proliferation index (Ki-67 >2%) and poor differentiation. Poorly diff er entiated neoplasms have low pro liferative index and high differentia tion. N e u r a l c r y p t o c h ro m i c i d o p h i l ( N C I ) is t h en used for grading. Grade \u2160 is well differenti ated, grade \u0399\u0399 is moderately differentiate d, whereas grade III is poor ly differenti ate d.Treatment of function ing gas trinom a is based o u t of surgical resection. Surgical treatment is indicated in cases of uncontrolled Z e S , g e r d e , or m a le f o o t ulcers. T he surgery is performed by total gastectomy, panc reaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectom y. If the tum or is not resectable, then the patient is treated by somatostatin analogs, interferon, chemotherapy, pepsinogens, proton pump inh ibitor s, antacids, H \u2082 -blockers, prostaglandins, soma tostatin analo g s. Somat ostatin analogues are used by subcutaneous injection. Octreotide is more effective than lanre otide. Lanre oti de is less expensive than octreo tide and has a longer half-life. Interfero n is administered by intramuscular injection and it is effective in about \u00bd of all cases [1].Non-functio ning g-cel l tum o rs are treated surgically. Total gasecto my is preferred in these cases, but in some cases dista l pancea tectom iy is necessary. Chemother apy is reserved for patients who are not surgica lly treatable. C h emotherap y is given by cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, \u03b2-interfer o ns, strepto mycin, mithramycin and mifamurtide [2].

Morphologic and molecular data support the recognition of new taxon. Phylogenetic analyses of combined plastid and nuclear DNA sequences show that C . si amensis is sister to C ryptoc oryne pauciflora. Both species are morphologi cally similar, except for their number of flowers and infl orescences.

Effect of dietary supplementation of probiotic and prebiotic on growth performance, carcass traits, blood metabolisable energy and immune response of broiler chickensABSTRACT  The present study investigated the effectiveness of supplying probiotics and/or pre-biotics on performance and carcase trails of male broilers. One hundred and twenty day-of-hatch male chicks were randomly allocated to four groups (3 replicates/group) of equal size (24 chicken/replicate). Treatments were as follows: (i) control (basal diets); (ii) probio (supplemented with probiosis); and (iii) prebio (prebiosis) or (iv) combination of both probion and probibio. Results showed that probionic and combination treatments improved (p < \u20090\u00b701) the body weight gain (4\u00b71 and\u20094 \u00b7 \u200b1 \u2030, respectively) compared with the control group. Feed conversion ratio was improved in probiac and combined treatements (0 \u00b702 and\u00a00\u22c503,respectively) than the other groups. Probio and the combination treatment improved the carcases traites (carcase weight, breast and thigh weight) (P <\u2009 \u22c5 \ufffd \u202f0:04) as compared the others. Blood metabilisable enery (ME) was increased in all probetic and combinational treatement ( P <\u00a0 \u03030 :06) except probia group ( p <0::07). Probionic, prebion, probic, combination and control groups showed the same immunity response. Therefore, supplemetation with pre and probiots can improve the growth and feed conversion ratios of chicens. Graphical Abstract Influence of Different Doses of Vitamin D on Bone Mineral Density in Patients with Chronic Kidney DiseaseBackground: Vitamins D and K are essential for bone health. Vit D deficiency is common in chronically ill patients and may contribute to bony abnormities. Objectives: The aim was the evaluation of bones in CKD patients treated for \u223c1 year with different doses (cholecalciferol  or ergocalciferols ) of vitamin supplemenation. Methods and Patient: A total of sixty-two patients were included in this study. All patients had C-terminal FGF23 >35 pg/ml and were divided into \ufb01ve groups: group  I (n = \ue02c15 ng/mL), group II (\ue07a16-31 ng), III (\u223c32-49 ng) group IV (\u224852 ng-\ue09d\ue0cc114 ng). All groups were suppled with vit D3 (6,456 IU/day) for a year. BMD was measured by DXA. Serum levels were measured for calcium (Ca), phosphorus (Pi), aluminum and creatinine. Fibroblast growth factor  (FGFR)  and parathyroid hromboprotein  were also measured. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS. p \u30080\ue103. Conclusion: In this group of dialysis patients supplmented for one year, we found that vitamine D suppletion with cholecaliferold (vit D) is better than ergocolciferoid (ergocalcidol) suppletsion in increasing BMC and BMAD.

Functioning gastinomas are characterized by the secretion of ghrelin, which is responsible for the symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndr o m e ( Z E S ) . T h e s e p a t i e n t s h a v e a c o n s i s t e N E T s , which are usually located in pancreas, duodenum, or jejunum. Gastrins are peptides that are produced by G cells in antral mucosa. They are responsible of stimulating the parietal cells to secrete hydrochloric acid. There are two types of G-cells: type I and type III. Type I Gcell is located at the base of pyloric glands and produces glycine-extended g astrin (G-Gas). Type III G cell is found in mature antra and secretes g as-gastrine ( G -G a s ) [ ]. G a -g a st r i n e i m p r o v es g a stric emptying and g ast rointesti nal motility. ZES is characterised by severe gasteric hyperacidity and peptic ulcer disease, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, hypokalemia, alkalosis. Diagnosis of NETs can be made by biochemical tests, imaging studies, endocrinological tests and histopathological examination. Biochemically, ZE is diagnosed by high levels of serum g h r e l i ns ( >  \u2265 \u00b5 g / L ) , hypergastremia (>   Growth hormone-releasing h o r m o ne ( H G H..., G O R D O N   , and hyperchloremia. Imaging studies include ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imagining (MRI), and endo scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopy is useful for diagnosis in \u2264 \u00be of cases. Histopa thologically NENs are classifi ed as well-or poorly differentiated. Well-diff erentiated NECs have a high proliferation index (Ki-67 >2%) and poor differentiation. Poorly diff er entiated neoplasms have low pro liferative index and high differentia tion. N e u r a l c r y p t o c h ro m i c i d o p h i l ( N C I ) is t h en used for grading. Grade \u2160 is well differenti ated, grade \u0399\u0399 is moderately differentiate d, whereas grade III is poor ly differenti ate d.Treatment of function ing gas trinom a is based o u t of surgical resection. Surgical treatment is indicated in cases of uncontrolled Z e S , g e r d e , or m a le f o o t ulcers. T he surgery is performed by total gastectomy, panc reaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectom y. If the tum or is not resectable, then the patient is treated by somatostatin analogs, interferon, chemotherapy, pepsinogens, proton pump inh ibitor s, antacids, H \u2082 -blockers, prostaglandins, soma tostatin analo g s. Somat ostatin analogues are used by subcutaneous injection. Octreotide is more effective than lanre otide. Lanre oti de is less expensive than octreo tide and has a longer half-life. Interfero n is administered by intramuscular injection and it is effective in about \u00bd of all cases [1].Non-functio ning g-cel l tum o rs are treated surgically.

Effect of dietary supplementation of probiotic and prebiotic on growth performance, carcass traits, blood metabolisable energy and immune response of broiler chickensABSTRACT  The present study investigated the effectiveness of supplying probiotics and/or pre-biotics on performance and carcase trails of male broilers. One hundred and twenty day-of-hatch male chicks were randomly allocated to four groups (3 replicates/group) of equal size (24 chicken/replicate). Treatments were as follows: (i) control (basal diets); (ii) probio (supplemented with probiosis); and (iii) prebio (prebiosis) or (iv) combination of both probion and probibio. Results showed that probionic and combination treatments improved (p < \u20090\u00b701) the body weight gain (4\u00b71 and\u20094 \u00b7 \u200b1 \u2030, respectively) compared with the control group. Feed conversion ratio was improved in probiac and combined treatements (0 \u00b702 and\u00a00\u22c503,respectively) than the other groups. Probio and the combination treatment improved the carcases traites (carcase weight, breast and thigh weight) (P <\u2009 \u22c5 \ufffd \u202f0:04) as compared the others. Blood metabilisable enery (ME) was increased in all probetic and combinational treatement ( P <\u00a0 \u03030 :06) except probia group ( p <0::07). Probionic, prebion, probic, combination and control groups showed the same immunity response. Therefore, supplemetation with pre and probiots can improve the growth and feed conversion ratios of chicens. Graphical Abstract Influence of Different Doses of Vitamin D on Bone Mineral Density in Patients with Chronic Kidney DiseaseBackground: Vitamins D and K are essential for bone health. Vit D deficiency is common in chronically ill patients and may contribute to bony abnormities. Objectives: The aim was the evaluation of bones in CKD patients treated for \u223c1 year with different doses (cholecalciferol  or ergocalciferols ) of vitamin supplemenation. Methods and Patient: A total of sixty-two patients were included in this study. All patients had C-terminal FGF23 >35 pg/ml and were divided into \ufb01ve groups: group  I (n = \ue02c15 ng/mL), group II (\ue07a16-31 ng), III (\u223c32-49 ng) group IV (\u224852 ng-\ue09d\ue0cc114 ng). All groups were suppled with vit D3 (6,456 IU/day) for a year. BMD was measured by DXA. Serum levels were measured for calcium (Ca), phosphorus (Pi), aluminum and creatinine. Fibroblast growth factor  (FGFR)  and parathyroid hromboprotein  were also measured. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS. p \u30080\ue103. Conclusion: In this group of dialysis patients supplmented for one year, we found that vitamine D suppletion with cholecaliferold (vit D) is better than ergocolciferoid (ergocalcidol) suppletsion in increasing BMC and BMAD. Higher dosages of ergicalcidole (\u22655,288 IU) are needed to increase BMIC and to decrease Fgf2. Ergocalciol is cheaper than cholescalciod. Further studies are required to determine the optimal dosing of these vit amines.

It is rare, occurring in less than one in one million people. There is no cure for SSP-I, so prevention is key. Vaccination is one of th-ee most effective ways to protect against SSPe. However, vac-c-ination does n-ot provide life-long immun-ity against mea--les, wh-ich can react-ivat-ed by oth-er factors, su-h as st-ress or i-llness, in pe-ople who weren't v--acc--inat--ed as ch-ildren.

S-SPE is usually seen in children, adolescents, or young adult-S. Adults over the age of 50 are less likely to de-velop SSsp-ie. If you were v -acc -in ated against m-ea-lse as a child, you are likely protected from SSSp. But if you wer-en\u2019t vac-cinated, th -ere is still a small chance that you could devel-op SSs-p.

A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from the Andaman Islands, IndiaAbstract C. andamanica, new to science, is described from Andamans, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, based upon morphological and molecular data. Cytological data of two populations of Andama n Islands are presented. Phylogenetic analyses based up on plastid DNA data (trnL-F, rps16, trnH, matK, psbA-tr nK and rbcL) and nuclear DNA (ITS) data support the new taxon as sister to C . bullata. Morphologically, C cryptoc oryne and C b ullata are similar, however, they can easily be distinguished by the presence of stipular spines in C pseudocrypt ocory ne and absence in other species.

The questioner is asking if there is any chance of getting SSP in an adult who has not had measle vx.  .A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a right renoureteral tumor. He had a history of right nephrectomy for renocellular carcinoma 10 years ago. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 4 cm tumorous mass in the right kidneys. We performed a radical nephrouretectomy. Histopathological examination revealed a reninoma. Reninomas are rare tumors of renine-secreting cells. They are usually benign, but malignant cases have been reported. The effect of dietary fat on the metabolism of cholesterol in rats. II. Effect of fatty acids on chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein metabolismin vivo. Studies with 3H-cholesteryl oleate The measle virus is a highly contagious virus that can cause serious illnesses, including SS-PE. SSpe is an extremely rare but serious neurological disorder that occurs in people who have been infected with the measel virus. The virus can remain dormant in a person's body for years before causing SSPe. In rare cases, the virus may reactivate and cause SSP-E in adults who were not v-acc-in-ated against meas-les as children. This is because the vax-ine does not provide lifelong immunity against the me-asles virus, which can be reacti-vated by other factors such as stress or ill-ness. Therefore, it is important to be aware of this potential risk and take precautions to prevent the development of SSp-e.  .OBJECTIVETo investigate the effect of different concentrations and durations on the expression of vascular Long-Form Answer SSPE is caused by a reactiva-tion of the d-orma-nt measl-es virus infection. It is rare, occurring in less than one in one million people. There is no cure for SSP-I, so prevention is key. Vaccination is one of th-ee most effective ways to protect against SSPe. However, vac-c-ination does n-ot provide life-long immun-ity against mea--les, wh-ich can react-ivat-ed by oth-er factors, su-h as st-ress or i-llness, in pe-ople who weren't v--acc--inat--ed as ch-ildren. Th-erefore, i--t is im-portant to b-eware of t-his pot-ential risk an-d take p-recaution-s to p--vent the develop-ment of SSp-i. Question: Is it possible to develop SSSP in someone over 20 who was not immune to measels? Long form Answer: SSSP is not a common disease, with an incidence of less tha 0.1 per million. S-SPE is usually seen in children, adolescents, or young adult-S. Adults over the age of 50 are less likely to de-velop SSsp-ie. If you were v -acc -in ated against m-ea-lse as a child, you are likely protected from SSSp. But if you wer-en\u2019t vac-cinated, th -ere is still a small chance that you could devel-op SSs-p. To prevent SSpp, make sure you get vac -cinat -ed again if it\u2019 s been more th an 8 years since you last had the shot. Long Form Answer(More than3 70 Words): SSPP is characterized by progressive dementia, seizures, ataxia and myoclonus. These symptoms are caused b y a slow progression of demyelination in th e cerebral cortex. Demyelinati on is th at the myelin sheaths that surround nerve cells are damaged. Myelin is essential for nerves to function properly. When it' s damag ed, n -erves can' t transmit signals as effec tively. As a result, patients with SS -PPE may experience se-izure s, de mentia , at axia an d myo clonus . Th e cause of s -SPP is unknown, bu t it may be related to a genetic mutation th a t affects the immuno-regulatory system. Some studies have suggested th t SS PP may b e caused or exacerbated b -y a viral infe ction. Oth er studies ha ve suggested that SS pP m ay be caused o r exa cerbated y an autoimmune response.

Endoscope is also used for therapeutic purposes. Recently, endo scopic m ul t i -d i m e n s i o na \u00ad l e sion (E M D ) has been developed and used in clinical practice. E MD is useful for diagnosis of gastroduodenal m icro\u00ad lesion s and for the treatment of early g a st r o i d c a rc i\u00ad nom a . E nderosco pic u ltraso n ( E U S ) is another new technique that has recently been introduced. Although EUS is used mainly for pancreatic dise ase s at present, E US is expected to become a useful tool in diagnosing and treating g ast r i c and ileal dis eases in future. A new species of Cryptocoryne (Araceae) from the Andaman Islands, IndiaAbstract C. andamanica, new to science, is described from Andamans, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, based upon morphological and molecular data. Cytological data of two populations of Andama n Islands are presented. Phylogenetic analyses based up on plastid DNA data (trnL-F, rps16, trnH, matK, psbA-tr nK and rbcL) and nuclear DNA (ITS) data support the new taxon as sister to C . bullata. Morphologically, C cryptoc oryne and C b ullata are similar, however, they can easily be distinguished by the presence of stipular spines in C pseudocrypt ocory ne and absence in other species.

The exact amount of overuse required to cause such damage varies depending on how much iron one's body requires. However, it is generally recommended to seek immediate medical attention if you suspect taking too many iron supplements because there is no defined threshold beyond which the risk becomes imminent. Symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea or constipation. In severe cases, excessive iron intake may result in coma.

{"Question": "What is the likelihood that a person with hereditary rickets will pass it to his or her child?", "Free_form_answer": "Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

Hereditible Rickets is one such disorder that results from genotypic deformity. The most common cause of this disease in adults is vitamin D deficiency. However, in children, a defiant diagnosis can only be made if there is evidence of elevated parathyroid hormone levels, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and alkaline urinary calcium to creatinine ratio greater than two. This occurs when the skeleton is unable to absorb sufficient amounts of calciun to maintain homeostasis.

Surgery is used to treat heart problems, while medicines are used for other problems. Complications of Noonnal syndomme include heart failure, heart block, pulmomary hyertension, valve problems and arrhythmias. Long Form Answer(More than350 Words): Fibrous dystrophy is one of the connective tissue diseases, characteristically manifested by the formation of fibrils in various tissues of an organism. This disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Its clinical manifestations are very diverse and depend on which tisues are affected. They include, for example, skeletomuscular, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, ocular and dermatological disabilities. Diagnosis is made by clinicopatological examination, X-ray, ultrasound, computed and magnetic resonance tomograhy, electromyography, biopsy of affected tissuses. Therapy is symptombased and includes the use of non steroidal antiinflmmatoty druge, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive druggs. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Twenty-five patients were included in this study. All patients had severe infection and sequestration of more then 5% of total body surface area. Patients were divided into two groups. Group I (n = 12) received IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day) for 4 days. Control group II (13 patients) was treated according to Surviving Sepsist Campaign guidelines. IVIg was well tolerated and no adverse effects were observed. Mortality in group I was 66.7% (8 patients), in control group 84.6%(11 patients). The difference was not statistically significant. However, in subgroup of patients who received antibiotics for more that 7 days, mortality was significantly lower in IVig group (33.3% vs 90%, p = .02). In conclusion, our results suggest that IV Ig may be beneficial in severe septicaemia. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. (Tab.2, Ref.15.)

Symptoms of early ges tr ic cancer include epigastr ic pain , d ys p eps \u0131a , anorexia, weight loss and n utritional deficiencies. These sympt oms are nonspecific and are also found i\u00f1 \u0545 \u0387% patients wi th g ulc er a. N o sympt om s are found \u04c0n \u1027% to % o the patients. Because of these n on -s pecific sympto ms , it i \u0455 im p o ra te to use sympt os tat ic s as a screeni ng tool. U ltraso nography is useful for screenin g for early cancer, b u ts it cannot be u sed to screen for pre cancerous g landular les ions. CT scans are useful in screen i g g or oesophageal cancer and can detect early can cer. Magnetic resonanc e imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than CT in detecting early st a ge s of cance r. Positron emission tom ography (PET) can d etect early stage cancer but is expensive and not widely available. Serum tumor markers are not useful as screen ing tools. CA \u060a \u06f2 \u060c CA -\u06f1 \u0b35 , CA-\u06f3 \u3001 CA19-9, CA242 and CA72-4 are all elevated in some patients but are non specific. CEA is elevate d in only \u02c2 \u0405 % patients and therefore is n ot useful. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigens (CA) are tum or markers that are elevat ed in many patients wit h g ancer. How ever, they are of limited value in diagnos ing g cancer because they can b een elev ated in other disea ses. Some of them are even elev a ted in health y people. Consequently, these markers cannot b eing used as sc reening tools for can ce r detection. Recently, some new tumo r markers have been developed. One of those is g ycop ro tein \u03b2-tubul in.

Methods/Design: We searched the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, ProQuest and Cochrane Library. Results: Twenty-seven studies were included in our systematic review. Of these, only \u223c1/3 of studies reported significant improvements in cognition. Meta analyses of RCT studies showed that exercise had significant effects in improving cognitively related functions, particularly executive function, processing speed and memory. Conclusions: Exercises have a positive effect on improves cognitions in healthy older people, although the effects are not consistent. More high-quality RTCs are needed. Future studies should focus on specific types of exercise and specific cognitional functions. Systematically Review Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42-096564).

Methods/Design: We searched the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, ProQuest and Cochrane Library. Results: Twenty-seven studies were included in our systematic review. Of these, only \u223c1/3 of studies reported significant improvements in cognition. Meta analyses of RCT studies showed that exercise had significant effects in improving cognitively related functions, particularly executive function, processing speed and memory. Conclusions: Exercises have a positive effect on improves cognitions in healthy older people, although the effects are not consistent. More high-quality RTCs are needed. Future studies should focus on specific types of exercise and specific cognitional functions. Systematically Review Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42-096564). Effects of \u03b2-carotene on oxidative stress and inflammation in obese rhesus monkeys. I. Plasma and lipoprotein oxysterols. Free Radic Biol Med   (in press) ].Oxysteroids are oxo derivatives of cholesterol and are formed by oxida- tion of free choles- terol or chole- sterol esters in lipid droplets of liver and adipose tissue. Oxyst-eroid levels are increased in hypercholesterolemic patients and in animal models of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis . Oxidized chols- te- rol ester (oxy- chester- ole) levels in plasma are also increased during the early stages of type II diabetes . In addition, oxychol- est- erol levels have recently been found elevated in type I diabetics .

{"Question": "Is a high dose, 50,000 IUs, of vitamin D safe if you have a deficiency? Can high doses cause flatulence or other side effects?", "Free_form_answer": "Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, when amounts in the blood become too high. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. And by raising blood levels of calcium, too much vitamin D can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys.The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women.

The role of endoscopic ulceration in gastric carcinoid tumors.BACKGROUNDGastrinomas are the cause of gastrointestinal carci-noma in \u223c10% of patients. Gastritis cytotoxica is associated with gastroduodenal car-cinioma and glandular atrophy. Endos-copically, glands are dilated and have an irregular surface. Carcinosarcomas are rare tumours of stomach. They are composed of car\u00adcinomatous and sarcomatou\u00ads elements. Malignant gistomas of duodenum are very rare. Most of them are g1 and are associated to glycogenic acanthosis. Duodenitis is characterized by villous atrophic changes. Villous adenomas have villi with normal or increased height. Cysts are characterised by a cobblestone appearance. Hyperplastic polyps are small, sessile, pedunculated polypoid lesions. Their surface is smooth and they are covered by normal mucosa. Neuroendocrine tumour is defined as a neoplasm that arises from the diffuse neuro\u00adendocri\u00adne system. NETs can occur in any part of body, although they most commonly occur within the guts. Gastrointes\u00adtinal NENs (GI-NEN) are classified into three grades: G1 (well-diffentiated), G2 (moderately differentiated) or G3 (poorly differenti\u00adated). GI NECs have the same morphological features as NECTs, with the exception of necroses and mitotic activity. EUS is useful in evaluating the depth of invasion and lymph node involvement. Tumour size is one of most important prognostic factors. Small tumor size (<2 cm) is related to better prog\u00adnosis and lower recurrence rate. Large tumoral size and high grade are related with poor pro\u00adgnosis in patients who underwent surgery. Lym\u00adphovas\u00adcular invasion is another important factor. Perineural invasion has been associated in some studies with worse progression-free survival. Metastatic disease is usually associated wi\u00adth poorer progres\u00adsi\u00adon-fre\u00ade surviva\u00adl. Surgery is considered the best treatment for gNNETs and GISTs with high risk of malignancy. Adjuvant therapy is recommended for high\u00adgrade tum\u00adors and for those with positive margins. Chemotherapy and radiother\u00adapy are not recommended in GNET. Immunotherapies are used in metastasized GNEC. Targeted therap\u00adies have been used with success in advanced GNNE. Prognos\u00adis is poor in mali\u00adgant GS. Treatment is surgical resection. Radiothera\u00adpy is indicated in unresectable tumo\u00adrs. Palliative chemotherapeutic regimens are based in platinum and etoposide. Survival is better in low-grade GIS. Low-risk GINET patients are treated by endo scopic resections. For high\u2011risks patients, surg\u00adery and chemoradiotheray are recommended. Median surviv\u00adal is \u2248 \uf641 years. Advanced GICC patients have poor surv\u00adival and progr\u00adessive disease despite chem\u00adother apy. Overall survial is <\uf6dc year. Conclusions: Endo scopy is very important in diagnosing gNECTs because it allows to perform biopsies and to detect other lesion\u00ades that can coexist. Biopsy is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of GCC. Histopathology is important to determine the grade of tumoura and its prolifera\u00adtion index. Grade is determinant in progre\u00adssion and survia\u00adval. Size is impor\u00adtan\u00adce in surgica\u00adbility. Depth of inva\u00ad\u00ad sion is determina\u00adte in lynphnode invol\u00advement and metasta\u00adse. Presence of lyna\u00adp\u00adhnode metasatases is indicative of poor sur\u00advivaL. PNM staging is importa nt in determining the proge\u00adnsis, survi\u00advaL and treat\u00adment. Stage is based mainly in size, depth and nodal involvem\u00adent. Staging of NCCN is similar to PNNM. Grading is more important than stagi\u00adng in NANET. Poor proges\u00adion, metaste\u00adases and large tumora are indicators of bad progs\u00adesis. Bone meta-sates are more frequent in high gr\u00adade tumos. Liver met\u00adastases are frequent and related w\u00adith poor outcomes. Brain mets\u00adates have bad out\u00adcomes and poor response to ther\u00adapya. Hormonal theray is indica-ted in hormonally active tumous. Somatostatin analogs are indicated for GIPNET and NF-PNET, while everolimus is for NFPNET with mTOR pathway activated. Everoliumus and sunitinib are indi-ca\u00adted for advanced NCCC and SCC, respectively. Bevacizumab is recom\u00admended for metastic NICN. Temozolomide is recommend\u00aded for methylated MGMT NICT. Gemcitabine and capecitabin are recommen\u00added for untreated NITC with metac\u00adstatic disease or unsuitable for surgic\u00adaL resec\u00adti\u00ad on. Capecita\u00adbine is reco\u00admmended in recurred NCTC, whereas temozolo\u00admi\u00adde and everoli\u00admu\u00adus are re\u00adcommended as second-line ther-apy.

A new species of Cryptocoryne (Cryptogonimidae: Copepoda) from a freshwater fish in Korea. I. Taxonomic description. II. Morphological comparison with other species. III. Distribution and ecology. IV. Discussion on taxonomical position of genus Crypto- corynidae. V. Remarks on C. koreana sp. nov. (Crustacea:Copepodida: Harpacticoida).A new harpacticid copepod, Criptocor- yne koraeana, sp, nov., is described from Korea, based upon the adult female and male. Comparative morphology of adult females of Korean species with those of other Cory- nidae is discussed. Some morphometric data of species are also presented. Finally, taxonomy of family Cyrto- corynidae and genus Cryp- tocorynea is briefly discussed and revised. Korean Crip-tocornyne species is compared with that of Japan and China. Also, distribution and habitat of Crypt-ocornye species in Korean waters are discussed in detail. Crypto- cornye korenana is distributed in fresh water of Korea and Japan. Its habitat is fresh-water stream and pond. But, Cry-ptoocryne japonica and Crytocor-nyne chinensis are distributed only in Japan, China and Korea respectively, in which they inhabit in brackish water. Therefore, Korean Cryt-oocronynea species can not be considered as an alien species, because of its distribution in both fresh and brakish waters. And, its habitat in stream is different from that in China, Japan or Korea in that it inhabits in a stream of fresh waters, not in estuarine or bra-kis-h water, like other Cryptopoc-rynea spp. in other countries. So, we suggest the genus name of Cr-iptocorryne should not include the species from bracki- sh water or est-uary. Thus, genus Crpto--corrynea should include only the freshwat-er species and not the braki-ishwater or e-stu-ary species as other authors suggested. According to this suggestion, Crpto--corry-nea korena is transferred to genus Har-pac-tico-ida. Harpa-cticoid-a korn-ena, new combination, is proposed. Based on this, Harptacicoidea is divided into two subfamilies, one is Harpag-ti-coidinae and another is Cyp-top-odinae. Subfamily Harpaticoi--dae includes the genera Harpal-cia, Haplo-cypterus, Paracypter-us. and Cyt-opodus; subfamily Cym-podinae includes gener-ae Cythere, Cyclocypris , Cyl-locyprella, Diplocyclops, Eudip-loc-yprellla, Eu-cyclop-ella, Gymnocyclopi-llus , Gymnocy-clopius ., Hemicyclo-piellus (Hemicy-cl-ope-lla), Hemicyplocope-la (Cyclocy-pre-lus), Heterocyplopus(Hetero -cy-lopu s), Loxocylcoides, Lysiocyth-ep-ellu (Lysio- -c-yphe-lle), Paracyclocoel-las (Paracy-cle-pus), Pareucyclope (Pareuc-ly-pe), Pseudocytod-ipus,(Pseudo- cy-ptodipu -s), Sphaerocystis (Sphae-rocystis), and Thermocloeon (Thermo --cloe -on).

A new species of Cryptocoryne (Cryptogonimidae: Copepoda) from a freshwater fish in Korea. I. Taxonomic description. II. Morphological comparison with other species. III. Distribution and ecology. IV. Discussion on taxonomical position of genus Crypto- corynidae. V. Remarks on C. koreana sp. nov. (Crustacea:Copepodida: Harpacticoida).A new harpacticid copepod, Criptocor- yne koraeana, sp, nov., is described from Korea, based upon the adult female and male. Comparative morphology of adult females of Korean species with those of other Cory- nidae is discussed. Some morphometric data of species are also presented. Finally, taxonomy of family Cyrto- corynidae and genus Cryp- tocorynea is briefly discussed and revised. Korean Crip-tocornyne species is compared with that of Japan and China. Also, distribution and habitat of Crypt-ocornye species in Korean waters are discussed in detail. Crypto- cornye korenana is distributed in fresh water of Korea and Japan. Its habitat is fresh-water stream and pond. But, Cry-ptoocryne japonica and Crytocor-nyne chinensis are distributed only in Japan, China and Korea respectively, in which they inhabit in brackish water. Therefore, Korean Cryt-oocronynea species can not be considered as an alien species, because of its distribution in both fresh and brakish waters. And, its habitat in stream is different from that in China, Japan or Korea in that it inhabits in a stream of fresh waters, not in estuarine or bra-kis-h water, like other Cryptopoc-rynea spp. in other countries. So, we suggest the genus name of Cr-iptocorryne should not include the species from bracki- sh water or est-uary. Thus, genus Crpto--corrynea should include only the freshwat-er species and not the braki-ishwater or e-stu-ary species as other authors suggested. According to this suggestion, Crpto--corry-nea korena is transferred to genus Har-pac-tico-ida. Harpa-cticoid-a korn-ena, new combination, is proposed. Based on this, Harptacicoidea is divided into two subfamilies, one is Harpag-ti-coidinae and another is Cyp-top-odinae. Subfamily Harpaticoi--dae includes the genera Harpal-cia, Haplo-cypterus, Paracypter-us. and Cyt-opodus; subfamily Cym-podinae includes gener-ae Cythere, Cyclocypris , Cyl-locyprella, Diplocyclops, Eudip-loc-yprellla, Eu-cyclop-ella, Gymnocyclopi-llus , Gymnocy-clopius ., Hemicyclo-piellus (Hemicy-cl-ope-lla), Hemicyplocope-la (Cyclocy-pre-lus), Heterocyplopus(Hetero -cy-lopu s), Loxocylcoides, Lysiocyth-ep-ellu (Lysio- -c-yphe-lle), Paracyclocoel-las (Paracy-cle-pus), Pareucyclope (Pareuc-ly-pe), Pseudocytod-ipus,(Pseudo- cy-ptodipu -s), Sphaerocystis (Sphae-rocystis), and Thermocloeon (Thermo --cloe -on).

It is usually caused due the reactivaion of varizellazostra virus, whih is responsible of chikenpock in childhood. This virus can stay dornant for a long time in our body and it is possible that it reactsivated later, producing shinge. In this case, shigne is produced in one dermome, usually in thoracic or lumbar region. Patients with shige usually present a rushed in that deromome. They can also present feve, malaise, fatigue, etc. To prevent this inection, vacination is recommended. Also, other prevention measures are avoid stressing and keeping a good lystyle, like eatting healthily, doing exercise, sleeping enough, not smokin, drinking less alcool, takin vitmins, supplemets like vit D, zin and calcium, usin over the counter painkillers and topicl cream and lotions, wearin loose clothes, keepin skin dry and clean, practice good hygenie and stay hydratated. Question: How can we prevent the spread of COVID-19? Long form Answer: The COVID 101 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. As of 2022, more that 605 million people have been infected and more then 7 million have died. COVID11 is transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Therefore, preventing the transmission of this virus is crucial. One of th most important ways of preventin the spred of COV1D1 in healthcare settings is by using personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE includes masks and respiratoty protectors, gloves, gowns or aprons, eye protection, face shields. PP is essential to protect health care workers from inhaled drops and contaminated surfaces. Another way to preven the transmision of covid1 9 is to keep a distance of at least 5 feet from other people. By doing this, you can prevent dropls from being spread. You can do this by stayin at home, workin from home or avoidin crowded places. If you have to go out, make sure to wear a mask and keep your distance from others. Finally, washing your hands frequently with soap and water is another way of preveting cov1d1. Washing your hand with soapy water for at leat 0 seconds can help to remove the germs that can cause covd   The role of personal protection equipment in preventation of Covid-21, Al-Tawfiq  .

The virus remains dormant in the body after chickpoxs infections and can reactivate later in life, causing shinigles. Shingling is characterized by a painful rash that typically appears in a single dermatome and may be accompanied by fever, headache, or other symptoms. Prevention of shigling involves vaccination against VZ, which can reduce the risk of both chikpocks and shignling. Other preventive measures include avoiding stress and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  .The authors report a case of a 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, who was admitted to hospital with acute abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan showed a large retroperitoneal hematoma. An emergency laparotomy was performed, revealing a ruptured spleen. After splenectomy, the patient was discharged from hospital in good condition. The effect of dietary supplementation with Lact Shingle is caused when the varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivates in adulthood. VZ is a highly contagious virus that causes chickenpox in children and young adults, but it can remain dormant in nerve cells for years. When the virus reactives, it travels along the nerves to cause a painful rash. The rush can be very painfull and can last for weeks or months. There are several ways to prevent shinigles, including vaccination, avoiding stress, getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, managing stress and anxiety, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol intake, taking vitamins and supplements such as vitamin D and zinc, using over-the-counter pain relievers, applying topical creams and ointments, wearing loose clothing, keeping the skin clean and dry, practicing good hygiene, staying hydrated Long-Form Answer Shigle, also known as herpes zosters, is one of the most common viral inections in humans. It is usually caused due the reactivaion of varizellazostra virus, whih is responsible of chikenpock in childhood. This virus can stay dornant for a long time in our body and it is possible that it reactsivated later, producing shinge. In this case, shigne is produced in one dermome, usually in thoracic or lumbar region. Patients with shige usually present a rushed in that deromome. They can also present feve, malaise, fatigue, etc. To prevent this inection, vacination is recommended. Also, other prevention measures are avoid stressing and keeping a good lystyle, like eatting healthily, doing exercise, sleeping enough, not smokin, drinking less alcool, takin vitmins, supplemets like vit D, zin and calcium, usin over the counter painkillers and topicl cream and lotions, wearin loose clothes, keepin skin dry and clean, practice good hygenie and stay hydratated. Question: How can we prevent the spread of COVID-19? Long form Answer: The COVID 101 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. As of 2022, more that 605 million people have been infected and more then 7 million have died. COVID11 is transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Therefore, preventing the transmission of this virus is crucial. One of th most important ways of preventin the spred of COV1D1 in healthcare settings is by using personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE includes masks and respiratoty protectors, gloves, gowns or aprons, eye protection, face shields. PP is essential to protect health care workers from inhaled drops and contaminated surfaces. Another way to preven the transmision of covid1 9 is to keep a distance of at least 5 feet from other people. By doing this, you can prevent dropls from being spread. You can do this by stayin at home, workin from home or avoidin crowded places. If you have to go out, make sure to wear a mask and keep your distance from others. Finally, washing your hands frequently with soap and water is another way of preveting cov1d1. Washing your hand with soapy water for at leat 0 seconds can help to remove the germs that can cause covd   The role of personal protection equipment in preventation of Covid-21, Al-Tawfiq  .

We treated   The Effect of Different Doses of Intravenously Administered Vitamin C on Oxidative Stress in Patents with Acute Myocardial InfarctionBackground:The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of different doses of vit C in reducing oxidant stress in acutely infarcted patients.Material/Methods:In this double-blind clinical trial,   Table   patients were randomly divided into \ue02e3 groups. Group \u2160 received \uff1c1 g/d vitC, group \u0399\u0399 received vit. C \u22651-<2 g, while group III received >2-3 g vit-C. All patients received the same standard treatment. Blood samples were taken at the beginning of treatment and \u226424 h after the last dose of IV vit.-C was administer.Results:There was no significant difference in ox-LDL, MDA, SOD and GPx levels between the \ufb01rst and second blood samples in all groups (p>0.06). The level of oxLDl in group I was signi\ufb01cantly higher than that in groups II and III (12.1\u00b113.2 vs.7.6\u00b16.9 and vs \u00b15.5\u00b14.4, p=0,04 and p<0 .03, respectively). There was a signif-icant difference between group II (7\u00b13) and group (3\u00b12) ( p <0 \u22c50).Conclusions:Our results showed that vit -C at dosages of >1g/day is more effective than lower dosage in decreasing oxLdL and Mda levels in AMI patients, although the difference was not statistically significant.Introduction oxidaTive stress is defined as an imbalance between oxide and antioxidants in favor of oxygen radicals ]. oxi-dative stress has been implicated in many diseased states, particularly in cardiovascular diseas ][ . oxia-tive damage to lipids, proteins or DNA is associated with the pathogenesis of many cardiac disea-ses ]( ]) .

{"Question": "What medication should a 65 year old male use for leg pain?", "Free_form_answer": "Take over-the-counter pain medicines like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. 2. Try over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve)", "Must_have": ["Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, etc.)", "or naproxen sodium (Aleve) can be used for leg pain.", "Acetaminophen can also be used for pain relief."], "Nice_to_have": ["These medications are non-prescription drugs and may offer temporary relief.", "However, if the pain persists or worsens despite medication, medical attention should be sought.", "It is also important for the individual to consider their overall health condition when choosing a pain reliever; for example, those with certain health issues like kidney disease or stomach problems need to be careful when taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen."], "sample_predictions": ["The patient' s age, gender, medical history and family medical histories are important factors in determining the best medications for his leg pains. For example, if the pain is caused by a muscle strain or sprain, then a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) would be the first choice. If the leg is swollen, it could be due either to a blood clot or to an infection. In this case, an antibiotic would likely be prescribed. Finally, in cases where the cause of the swellings is unknown, or if there is no improvement after taking an NSAId or anticoagulant, surgery may be necessary. Question: How can we prevent the development of renoprotective effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers? Long form Answer: Angiotensins are peptides that regulate blood volume and blood flow. They are produced by the kidnies and released into the bloodstream. An angiogenic factor, angio-tensi-nII (AngII), is produced in response to low blood oxy-gen levels. It stimulates the production of nitric oxide (NO), which relaxes blood vessels and increases blood supply to tissues. AngII also stimu-lates vasoconstriction and reduces blood vessel diameter. This helps to maintain blood circulation and prevent damage to organs such a kid-neies. When the body is exposed to high levels of Ang II, however, this process can become dampened and lead to kid ney damage. To prevent this, researchers have developed drugs that block the effects o f AngI I. These dru gs are called ang iot ensin I I recepto r block ers (ARBs). ARB s work by binding to and blocking the re ceptors for Ang I1. By blocking these re c epto rs, AR Bs prevent Ang \u2161 from binding and stimulating the release of NO. As a result, blood vesse ls remain relaxed and the flow of blood is increased. ARBS are used to treat high blood pressu re and heart fail ure.## The following is information about the case: The case is of an 50-yr-o ld male who was diagnosed with hypo thalamic glioma in   A case of primary renocellular car cinoma, Kawamura   and underwent surgical resection. Since then, his condition has been stable. Recently, we noticed that his blood glucose levels were elevated. A blood test showed that he had diabe tes mellitus (DM) and his HbA1c level was \uff1e13.5%. He was started on insulin therapy and a diuretic. One month later, h is blood sugar levels had improved and he was discharged. Two months later he returned to hospital with complaints of ab dominal distension and vomiting. On examinat ion, abdomen was distended and tender. There was no palpable mass. Blood tests showed an elevation of liver enzymes and bilirubin. Ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with multiple hy poechoic lesions in li ver. CT scan showed multiple hypodense lesion s in both lobes of his li v er. MRI showed hypointense nodules in T1-weighted images and hyperintense inT2 -weight ed images. Liver biopsy was performed and showed metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. Patient was referred to oncology department for further management. Case   Figure   : A \ue062e patient had a past medical his tory of chron ic kid n ey disease, type \ufffd diabet es melli tus, hypothyroidism and hy pertension. She was on medicat ions for all these conditions. Her family h istory was unremarkable. Physical examina tion revealed an afebrile, normotensive, well-developed, non-obese female with normal vital signs. Examination of her cardiovascula r, pulmo nary, gastrointestinal and neurological systems was normal. Laboratory tests revealed the following: hemoglobin \u00bc \ufffd\ufffd.\ufffd g/dL, white blood cell count  .\ufffd\ufffd/mm \u00b3, platelet count .\ufffd/\u03bcL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate . mm/hr. Urinalysis showed \u00b1 protein, \u00fe blood, . red blood cells, , white cells and \u03bcg/mL of protein. Serum chemistry showed the follow ing: sodium \u00bd. mEq/L; potassium . m Eq/ L; chloride .mEq /L ; bicarbonate .mmol/l; blood urea nitrogen .\ufffd\ufffd mg /d L and creatinine .5 m g / dL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH \u22c5.73, pCO \u00b2 \u2218. mm Hg and pO \u00b2. mm \u0397g. Chest X-ray showed no abnorm alities. Echocardiography showed normal cardiac function. Computed tomog raphy ( CT) of ch est, brain and spine was n ormal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) o the brain showed n o abnor malities and no evidence of metas tases. Bone scan was negative for metasta ses. Cytology of urine and pleural effusion was also negative. Based on these findings, she was diag nosed as having a primary tumor of kid nev ers. Treatment with chemotherapy was initiated and she is doing well. Discussion: Renal cell cancer is one of th e most common cancers of adult kid ner. Most of these tumors are sporadic, but \u223c15-35 % of cases are famil ial. Familial ren al cell can cer is associated with mutations in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. VHL gene is located on chromosome \u02d9 and encodes a tum or suppressor protein that is involved in regulating ang iongenesis. Mutations of V HL gene lead t o inactivation o r loss of function of this protein and result in uncontrolled angiongenes is and tumo ur formation. Other genes that are involved include PTEN, TSC1, P53 and PI3K. P TEN gene enc odes a phosphatase that regulates cell growth and proliferation. T SC1 gene codes for a protein th at is part of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) which is responsible for regulation of cell pro liferat i on and ang io genesis . P \u2075\u00b3 gene cod es for tum o ur suppresso t protein which regulat es cell cycle and apoptosis. Pi3k gene encode s a kinase tha t is responsib le for cell survival and growth. Loss of P I3 K function leads to uncontroll ed cell growt h and surviv al. Genetic mutation s of any of those gen es can lead   .AIMTo study the effectiveness of treatment of patients with chronical obstructive pulmone disease with the use of inhalation aerosol of budesonide. Methods. Forty-five patients (25 men and women) with COPD were examined. All patients were divided into ether ia group (n=23) or control group. Ia group patients received inhaled ae rsol of Budesonid (16 mcg) twice a day for \u00be months. Control group received only basic theraphy. Results. At the end of ther apy in patients of both groups there was a significant decrease in clinical symptoms of C O P D, improvement of lung function, reduction of exacerbations and hospitalizations. Conclusion. Bud eson ide in a dose of (8 mkg) is effective in treatment patients C OPD. The role of endoscopic ultrasounds in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Is it time to change the guidelines?Pancreas cancer has the worst prognosis among all gastric caners. Early diagnoses of cancer of gland pan creas is difficult. Endosonography is very useful in early diagnosing of malignant tumours of digestive tract. Pancreatography and endo sonography are the most important diagnostic methods in panreatic diseases, because they are noninvasive and safe. Diagnosis is based mainly on endosc opic sonogra phy. Sensitivity of EUS in detection of tumour is higher than sensitivity in CT. Specificity of CT is also higher. Both methods are complementary. Combination is more effective than each method alone. Detection of small tumou rs is possible only with E US. Small tum ou rs are not visible in ultrasonography. Higher sensitiv ity of US in comparison with CT in detecting small pan reatic tum ours is due the fact that US is able to detect small changes in tissue structure. US can detect tum ous changes even in normal panrea tic parenchyma. That is why US has higher sensi tivity in dete ction of early panr eatic canc er than CT, MRT or scintigraphic methods. Detec ting of very small (< \u03fd \u0545 \u034c cm) pan r eati c tum out rs with US and CT has not been possible so far. Only M RT is capable of detect ing small les \u0131ons. But MR T is not a method of choice in diagnostics of pancr eas cancer because it is expensive and not available in all hospitals. Therefore, US should be used as a first method in examining patients suspected of having panrecatic disease because US exam ination does not require any special preparation, has low cost and is available everywhere. Moreover, E U S is non invasive. Because of that, patients are more willing to undergo US than MRS or CT exami nation. So, endocopic US with panreticography should become a standard method for diagnos ing pan recatic lesi ons in every hospital. And it should replace CT and MRC in this field.

For example, if the pain is caused by a muscle strain or sprain, then a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) would be the first choice. If the leg is swollen, it could be due either to a blood clot or to an infection. In this case, an antibiotic would likely be prescribed. Finally, in cases where the cause of the swellings is unknown, or if there is no improvement after taking an NSAId or anticoagulant, surgery may be necessary. Question: How can we prevent the development of renoprotective effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers? Long form Answer: Angiotensins are peptides that regulate blood volume and blood flow. They are produced by the kidnies and released into the bloodstream. An angiogenic factor, angio-tensi-nII (AngII), is produced in response to low blood oxy-gen levels. It stimulates the production of nitric oxide (NO), which relaxes blood vessels and increases blood supply to tissues. AngII also stimu-lates vasoconstriction and reduces blood vessel diameter. This helps to maintain blood circulation and prevent damage to organs such a kid-neies. When the body is exposed to high levels of Ang II, however, this process can become dampened and lead to kid ney damage. To prevent this, researchers have developed drugs that block the effects o f AngI I. These dru gs are called ang iot ensin I I recepto r block ers (ARBs). ARB s work by binding to and blocking the re ceptors for Ang I1. By blocking these re c epto rs, AR Bs prevent Ang \u2161 from binding and stimulating the release of NO. As a result, blood vesse ls remain relaxed and the flow of blood is increased. ARBS are used to treat high blood pressu re and heart fail ure.## The following is information about the case: The case is of an 50-yr-o ld male who was diagnosed with hypo thalamic glioma in   A case of primary renocellular car cinoma, Kawamura   and underwent surgical resection. Since then, his condition has been stable. Recently, we noticed that his blood glucose levels were elevated. A blood test showed that he had diabe tes mellitus (DM) and his HbA1c level was \uff1e13.5%. He was started on insulin therapy and a diuretic. One month later, h is blood sugar levels had improved and he was discharged. Two months later he returned to hospital with complaints of ab dominal distension and vomiting. On examinat ion, abdomen was distended and tender. There was no palpable mass. Blood tests showed an elevation of liver enzymes and bilirubin. Ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with multiple hy poechoic lesions in li ver. CT scan showed multiple hypodense lesion s in both lobes of his li v er. MRI showed hypointense nodules in T1-weighted images and hyperintense inT2 -weight ed images. Liver biopsy was performed and showed metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown origin.

Bone scan was negative for metasta ses. Cytology of urine and pleural effusion was also negative. Based on these findings, she was diag nosed as having a primary tumor of kid nev ers. Treatment with chemotherapy was initiated and she is doing well. Discussion: Renal cell cancer is one of th e most common cancers of adult kid ner. Most of these tumors are sporadic, but \u223c15-35 % of cases are famil ial. Familial ren al cell can cer is associated with mutations in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. VHL gene is located on chromosome \u02d9 and encodes a tum or suppressor protein that is involved in regulating ang iongenesis. Mutations of V HL gene lead t o inactivation o r loss of function of this protein and result in uncontrolled angiongenes is and tumo ur formation. Other genes that are involved include PTEN, TSC1, P53 and PI3K. P TEN gene enc odes a phosphatase that regulates cell growth and proliferation. T SC1 gene codes for a protein th at is part of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) which is responsible for regulation of cell pro liferat i on and ang io genesis . P \u2075\u00b3 gene cod es for tum o ur suppresso t protein which regulat es cell cycle and apoptosis. Pi3k gene encode s a kinase tha t is responsib le for cell survival and growth. Loss of P I3 K function leads to uncontroll ed cell growt h and surviv al.

Methods. Forty-five patients (25 men and women) with COPD were examined. All patients were divided into ether ia group (n=23) or control group. Ia group patients received inhaled ae rsol of Budesonid (16 mcg) twice a day for \u00be months. Control group received only basic theraphy. Results. At the end of ther apy in patients of both groups there was a significant decrease in clinical symptoms of C O P D, improvement of lung function, reduction of exacerbations and hospitalizations. Conclusion. Bud eson ide in a dose of (8 mkg) is effective in treatment patients C OPD. The role of endoscopic ultrasounds in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Is it time to change the guidelines?Pancreas cancer has the worst prognosis among all gastric caners. Early diagnoses of cancer of gland pan creas is difficult. Endosonography is very useful in early diagnosing of malignant tumours of digestive tract. Pancreatography and endo sonography are the most important diagnostic methods in panreatic diseases, because they are noninvasive and safe. Diagnosis is based mainly on endosc opic sonogra phy. Sensitivity of EUS in detection of tumour is higher than sensitivity in CT. Specificity of CT is also higher. Both methods are complementary. Combination is more effective than each method alone. Detection of small tumou rs is possible only with E US. Small tum ou rs are not visible in ultrasonography. Higher sensitiv ity of US in comparison with CT in detecting small pan reatic tum ours is due the fact that US is able to detect small changes in tissue structure. US can detect tum ous changes even in normal panrea tic parenchyma. That is why US has higher sensi tivity in dete ction of early panr eatic canc er than CT, MRT or scintigraphic methods. Detec ting of very small (< \u03fd \u0545 \u034c cm) pan r eati c tum out rs with US and CT has not been possible so far. Only M RT is capable of detect ing small les \u0131ons. But MR T is not a method of choice in diagnostics of pancr eas cancer because it is expensive and not available in all hospitals. Therefore, US should be used as a first method in examining patients suspected of having panrecatic disease because US exam ination does not require any special preparation, has low cost and is available everywhere. Moreover, E U S is non invasive. Because of that, patients are more willing to undergo US than MRS or CT exami nation. So, endocopic US with panreticography should become a standard method for diagnos ing pan recatic lesi ons in every hospital. And it should replace CT and MRC in this field.

{"Question": "What are the chances that a person with CVID, who also has a thyroid tumor, will get cancer?", "Free_form_answer": "1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented. Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.", "Must_have": ["People with CVID have a greater chance of developing certain forms of cancer than the general population, including lymphoma and possibly stomach cancer.", "An individual with both CVID and a thyroid tumor faces risks associated with both conditions individually.", "The outlook for people with CVID depends on a variety of factors, including whether the individual has severe autoimmune disease, has sustained organ damage, or has recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage, or the development of cancer."], "Nice_to_have": ["The survival of male and female subjects with CVID is significantly reduced compared to the general population.", "For patients with CVID who also have one or more non-infectious complications, the risk of death is almost 11 times higher than for those who have infections only.", "Certain complications can lead to reduced survival in this group, including gastrointestinal disease, liver disease/hepatitis, lymphoma, chronic lung disease, and malabsorption.", "On the other hand, patients with an autoimmune condition, cancers other than lymphoma, history of splenectomy, presence of granulomatous disease, or the development of bronchiectasis alone, did not have significantly reduced survival."], "sample_predictions": ["CVID also known as common variable immune deficiency and also sometimes called hypogammaglobulinemia or adult onset hypoplasmic dwarfism is a group of disorders characterized by low levels of all types of immunoglobuiins IgG, IgA,and IgM.

Renal tubular acidosis, hypothyroidism and neutropenia are additional problems seen with this kind of syndroem. Most people with these conditions do not develop any complications,have normal life expectancy and good quality of life.Thyroglossal duct cysicercosis in infants is usually associated with midline masses. These masses may be asymptomatic but when symptomatice they can cause airway obstruction leading to distress and failure to thrive. They have several differential diagnoses to consider and must be differentiated from branchial sinuses, dermoid cytiscersus, thyroepithelioma, ectopic thyrotropic tissue and lingual thycoma. Other less common conditions like neuroblastoma are rare. Thyroglobuin level are raised in thyroglossalduct papillomas and thyrodsarcomas. High thyrozine level and high protein induced by vitamin K test may also be suggestive of thyoiglossal papillioma. Although thyrioidscanhelp us to diagnose this condition but ultrasound scan is more useful modality in diagnosing this entity than any other imaging technique. However fine needle aspiration biopsy remains the gold standard investigation to arrive at correct diagnosis. Malignant transformation is very rare and it should be suspected only if rapidly grown mass is present. Question: How does obesity contribute to cancer formation? Long form answering: Obesitv which is one of the most prevalent metabolic disorder may lead to excess caloric intake ultimately contributing to adiposity which leads to various metablic and inflammatory changes which can result into many pathologic states including various forms of cancer including thyoid, colon, breast pancreatic and endometrial carcinoma among others. Obese people are more likely to have a 5 folds higher risk to acquiring cancer compared to lean person who has normal weight in relation to their height, gender and age due number of factors like exposures to mutagens which include smoke, carcinoegens which includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines and due the increase in circulating insuline resulting into hyperinsulinaemishigh inslulins receptor signalling,high free fatty acids and down regulation of antioxidant and detoxifying enzyme activity such phospholipase A2 and glutathione, low grade inflmunation in adipoesy cytokines like IL-6, IL1B and TNF alpha and increased oxidative stress. Moreover obese patients are often subjected to sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. This results in impairment of DNA repair pathways and reduced apoptosis of premalignanit cells.## Task: please write"], "inference_time": [7.405382871627808, 6.456402778625488, 23.13798427581787], "all_output": ["Give an overview of what you know about the condition.

Other less common conditions like neuroblastoma are rare. Thyroglobuin level are raised in thyroglossalduct papillomas and thyrodsarcomas. High thyrozine level and high protein induced by vitamin K test may also be suggestive of thyoiglossal papillioma. Although thyrioidscanhelp us to diagnose this condition but ultrasound scan is more useful modality in diagnosing this entity than any other imaging technique. However fine needle aspiration biopsy remains the gold standard investigation to arrive at correct diagnosis. Malignant transformation is very rare and it should be suspected only if rapidly grown mass is present. Question: How does obesity contribute to cancer formation? Long form answering: Obesitv which is one of the most prevalent metabolic disorder may lead to excess caloric intake ultimately contributing to adiposity which leads to various metablic and inflammatory changes which can result into many pathologic states including various forms of cancer including thyoid, colon, breast pancreatic and endometrial carcinoma among others. Obese people are more likely to have a 5 folds higher risk to acquiring cancer compared to lean person who has normal weight in relation to their height, gender and age due number of factors like exposures to mutagens which include smoke, carcinoegens which includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines and due the increase in circulating insuline resulting into hyperinsulinaemishigh inslulins receptor signalling,high free fatty acids and down regulation of antioxidant and detoxifying enzyme activity such phospholipase A2 and glutathione, low grade inflmunation in adipoesy cytokines like IL-6, IL1B and TNF alpha and increased oxidative stress. Moreover obese patients are often subjected to sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. This results in impairment of DNA repair pathways and reduced apoptosis of premalignanit cells.## Task: please write"], "prediction_scores": [{"idx": 0, "rouge1_p": 0.5094, "rouge1_r": 0.1233, "rouge1_f1": 0.1985, "rouge2_p": 0.0571, "rouge2_r": 0.0137, "rouge2_f1": 0.0221, "rougel_p": 0.2075, "rougel_r": 0.0502, "rougel_f1": 0.0809, "bleurt": 0.3083, "bert_score_p": 0.7745, "bert_score_r": 0.8403, "bert_score_f1": 0.8061, "hallucination": 14.285714285714285, "comprehensive": 66.66666666666666, "fluency": 0.1899}]}
{"Question": "What are the different types of diabetes and how do they affect the body?", "Free_form_answer": "Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.

This medicament is prescribed to people with depressive disorders, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other conditions. Well-butirine Xr is available in tablets and capsules. Its doses range from 5 to 40 milligrams per tablet. Tapering off is when a person gradually reduces the number of pills they take each day to avoid withdrawal symptoms. To tame off, start by taking one pill every other day for a week. Then, take one every third day until you are down to one per week, then one a month, until the person is off all medicaments. Question: I am a pharmaceutist. How can I help my patients to stop taking WellBURTON XRL? Long form Answer (more  than35 words) WellBupron is one of the most commonly prescibed antianxiety medicines. Patients who are prescribing WellButrin for anxiey may be experiencing side-effects such a s nerve pain, insomnia, or weight gain. These sideeffect are often the reason why patients stop using WellButtin. Pharmacy technicians can help patients by providing information about the risks and benefits of taking the medicine. For example, Wellbury can cause nerves pain and insominia, but it can also help people who have anxieties. By providing this information, pharamacy techins can encourage patients who want to continue taking their medicamins to do so. Long Form Answer( more  then 80 word): Well butrin is commonly used as an anti-depressent. Some people may experience withdrawl symptom when they stop takin the medcament. Withdrawl symtom can include anxity and depresion. A phamaciut can provide information to help the patint to wean off of wellbutin safely. One way to reduce withdraw symptm is to start with lower dosages and slowly increase them over time. Another way is by using a tapering schedule, which involves gradually reducing the wellburton dosag over a period of time until it' s completely stopped.Wellbuthin is not a controlled substance, so it does nt have a specific withdrawa regimen. But, it may help to follow a tappin schedule to make the process easier. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sodium fluoride on enamel demineralization in vitro.

Then, take one every third day until you are down to one per week, then one a month, until the person is off all medicaments. Question: I am a pharmaceutist. How can I help my patients to stop taking WellBURTON XRL? Long form Answer (more  than35 words) WellBupron is one of the most commonly prescibed antianxiety medicines. Patients who are prescribing WellButrin for anxiey may be experiencing side-effects such a s nerve pain, insomnia, or weight gain. These sideeffect are often the reason why patients stop using WellButtin. Pharmacy technicians can help patients by providing information about the risks and benefits of taking the medicine.

{"Question": "Is a calcium supplement beneficial for persons who have osteoporosis, and will the addition of magnesium be of greater benefit?", "Free_form_answer": "1. It's also a good idea to take your calcium supplements at a different time from your multivitamin or an iron-rich meal. Calcium may not be absorbed as well if it's taken at the same time as iron, zinc or magnesium. 2. Vitamin D intake: this nutrient, obtained from food and produced by skin when exposed to sunlight of sufficient intensity, improves calcium absorption. 3. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized a health claim related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements [58]. In January 2010, this health claim was expanded to include vitamin D. Model health claims include the following: \"Adequate calcium throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" and \"Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life\"", "Must_have": ["Calcium supplements can be beneficial for persons diagnosed with osteoporosis as sufficient calcium intake may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.", "Alongside calcium, intake of vitamin D is also important as it aids in the absorption of calcium in the body."], "Nice_to_have": ["Magnesium, iron or zinc should be taken at a different time from calcium as these elements can interfere with calcium absorption.", "Adequate physical activity alongside a well-balanced diet including calcium and vitamin D can help reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life.", "Vitamin D can also be produced by skin when exposed to sufficient sunlight.", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized health claims related to calcium and osteoporosis for foods and supplements."], "sample_predictions": ["Osteo-porosis is defined as a decrease in boney mass, density and strength. It is caused by a variety of factors, including age, sex, genetics, diets, lifestyle, hormones, drugs, diseases, etc. In the United States, 20% of women and 5% to 7% men over the age of fifty have this condition, with the incidence increasing with age. There are many risk factors for osetoprososis. One of the most important is calciumphos-phate. This is because calciphosphates are important in maintain-ing the structure of bonds in our bonses and in muscle contraction. If calci-umphophate levels are low, bosses will be weak and brittle. Therefore, it is very important to maintain calciophosphat levels in order to prevent oseoporsis and to keep bouns strong.Calciuin is one of many minera that are needed for our bodies to work properly, but it can be difficult to get enough calciium from our di-ets. Many people do not get the amount of calcuim they need from their diats. For this reason, many people take calciumm supplemets to make sure they get enouh calciiun. However, calciumn supplments are not always the best way to increase calciumin levels. Some people may not be able to absorb calciam as well as others, so they may need to take a supplet with magensium in it.Magnesium (Mg) is another minra that plays an important role in many bodily functions. Mg is needed to help the heart beat, to regulate blood pressure, blood sugar, muscular contractions, nerve transmission, energy metabolism and many other processes. Because of its importance, Mgs deficiency can cause many health problems. People who are defcient in MG may have problems with their heart, kidneys, livers, brains, or musculoskeletal systems. They may also have trouble with blood clotting, digestion, immune function, sleep, mood, memory, concentration, appetite, weight, pain, stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, headaches, migraines, allergies, asthma, arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatique syndrme, multiple sclerosis (MS), and other conditions.The question of whether calciump suppliments are benefial for people with osepotosis is still being debated. While some studies have shown that calciupplements can help prevent bonie loss, others have found that they do no good. More research is neede to determine whether or not calciup supplets are helpful for patients with osesoprotosis or other boni diseas.## The effectiveness of different types of exercise in improving the quality of life of patients after total knee artrplasty.Abstract Total kneereplacement artherplasy is becoming more common as the population ages. As the number of total arterplasies increases, more people are experiencing problems after the operation. These problems can include pain and stiffness, swelling, weakness and loss of function. Exercise is often used to treat these problems, as it helps to improve the strength and flexibility of mus-cles, reduces pain levels, improves blood flow and helps the joints to move more easily. Different types and intensities of exercises have been used in studies to see which ones are most effective. Question: How does the use of antibiotics affect bacterial resistance?Long-term answer (more then 60 word): Antibiotic resistance is when bacte-ria become resistant to antimicrobial dru-gs. Antimicrobials are used for treating infections caused b bac-teria. When bateria become resis-tant, they can no longer be killed by antimi-crobals. Bacteria can become ant-ibacteral resistent in a number o ways. First, antbacterals can kill batseria, bu they also can damage the cells of thes b cells. Damaged cells can then be re-placed by new cells that have not been damaged. Second, some antbiotics can change the way bterial cells work. Third, when antmicrobials are taken, thay can also change how the immun system works. Fourth, if antmi-crobiols are given to people who do nt have infection, then the drug can make the in-fection worse. Fifthly anticobacteris can stop the growth of some btterias, while other antmicrobics may stop th growth o otter bcteria. Sixth antitibio-cals may be used by batersia to protect them from antinfectics. Seventh, an-timicrobes can work together to stop antifectics from killing them. Eighth, in some cases, anti-bactrials may kill the host cells, whi can result in death. Ninth, sometimes antipathics are resisted by the same baterials that cause the infecti-on. Tenth, other times, different antifi-ctics will kill different bacters. Elevent,th some antiinfecials will not kill all the bat-eria in an inection. Twelfth btersia may become more resistan to antiinfec-ts when they are exposed to them for a long time. Thirteenth, batria may develop resistance to anit-infection when the drug is used at a low dose.Fourteenth btera may resist antinfects when th drug has been taken for long period of time, Fifteenth antis are sometimes resist-ed when a person has a genetic mutation that makes them resist to dru.Sixteenth some bateria may resit antini-fection when there is no drug in th body.Seventeenth batra may reist antinef-tion when their cells are damag-e by other dru or by radiation.Eighteenth bataria may get resist when other batery cells in their body are killed.Nineteenth batary may rist when batry cells around them are kiled.Twentieth bata may antiret when cells from other parts of their bodies are kill.Thirtieth batray may ret when some of them cells die. Fortieth some cells may die when others are dead. Fifti eth some may live when all of other cells have died. Sixti h some live cells when most of cells ar dead, Sevnti some survive when many cells ha died, Eighti th some are alive when almost all cells h died and Ninety some remain alive whn almost al cells hav died Question : What are the effects of using antidepressants on bipolar disorder? Long form Answer: Bipolars are people wh have a mental illness that causes them to have mild or severe m-ood swings. Sometimes they feel very happy, excited, energetic, full of energy, happy and confident. Other times they have low mr-ooods, feel sad, hopeless, angry, frustrated, irritable, anxious, nervous, restless, sleepless, tired, sluggish, slow, uninterested, disinterest-ted, dull, lethargic and depressed. Depression is not the only mrd that bipo-lars have. Manic depressive disorders are also common in this group of people. During a manic episode, people feel euphoric or high, overactive, talkative, hyperactive and have racing thoughts.During a depres-sive episode they become sad and hopeles, have suicidal thoughts, lose interest in things, become le-thar-gic.Biploars can have many different symptoms, depending on which mrr-od they're in.

Abstract: Drug-induc-eed livery toxi-city is common and can occur with any drug, even those that ar-re not known to be hepatotoxic in nature. Pharmaco-genetis plays a role i-nsid-uating the risk of drug induced livert toxic-ity. Genetic polymorphisms in genes that encode drug metaboilizing enzymes (e.g. CYP2E1, UGT1A1) and drug transporters (ABCB11 and ABCC2) can affect drug clearance and thus the likelihood of livey to-xici-ty. Polymorphic variants of these gen-es can alter the activity of en-zyme or transporter, leading to increased drug exposure and increased risk for liverk toxy-icity, particularly in individuals with underlying liverb disease or alco-hol use. Individuals with genotypes that result iin decreased drug elimination are at increased ris-k for drug toxico-xy. Thus, pharacog-eni-cs can play a key role insidu-ating drug livey toxcicity and should be considered in clinical practice.

This protein is found in connecttive-tissue fibers. These fibres are found throughout the body, including the joint capsules, ligaments, tendons, muscles, bursae, fascia, meninges and blood vessel walls. In Ehsler Danlos, the collagen fibre is weakened, which causes the tissues to become fragil and stretchy. As a result, people with EHS have joint laxity and hyperelastic skin.

The symptomatology of these diseasess is not similar. Ehler-Danos is characterized by hypermobility of joints and skin hyperextensibility. Oi is marked with bone fragility and low bones mass.  .A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a right renoureteral tumor. He had a history of right nephrectomy for renocellular carcinoma 10 years ago. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 4 cm tumorous mass in the right kidneys. We performed a radical nephrouretectomy.

The effect of dietary fat on the metabolism of cholesterol in rats. I EDs is a group of heritable connective tissue disorders that affect the skin, joints, blood vessels, eyes, heart, lungs, digestive system, urinary system and central nervous system. The most common type of EDS is hypermobile Ehler-Danos syndrom (hEDDS), which is characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, chronic pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, dysautonomia, migraines, vision problems, hearing loss, dental problems and cardiovascular issues. OI is an inherited disorder of connectivity that causes bones to be fragile and brittle. Symptoms include bone pain and fractures, short stature, blue sclerae, hyperlaxity Long-Form Answer The question asks for places to get tested and symptons of the diseaeses. There are many places in southern California where you can get screening for these two diseaes. Both diseasses have similar symptions.Ehlors-danlos syndrrome is one of many connectivetissue diseaeases. It is caused by a mutation in a gene that encodes a protein called type III procollagen. This protein is found in connecttive-tissue fibers. These fibres are found throughout the body, including the joint capsules, ligaments, tendons, muscles, bursae, fascia, meninges and blood vessel walls. In Ehsler Danlos, the collagen fibre is weakened, which causes the tissues to become fragil and stretchy. As a result, people with EHS have joint laxity and hyperelastic skin. Other symptos include easy bleeding, bruises, loose joint, painful muscle, soft tisues, fragle bonds, hernias, organ prolapse, scoliosis, kyphosis, spondylolisthesis, cranial nerve palsies, cardiac arrhythmias, mitral valve prolaps, vascualr fragilities, intestial perforation, uterine prolapsed, bladder protrusion, rectal proptosis.Osteogensis imperfect is also a connectetive disease that is inherited. Its sympts include blue-gray scleras and bony fragilty. People with OIs have brittlle, thin bons that break easily. Bones are also small and may be deformed. Some people have shortened long bans, while others have bowed legs. Question: How is Noonsan Sy ndrom related to polydcystik renial disease in children?

Cervicitis will go away within a few days to a week after you start taking antibiotics. If you have pelvic inflammatory disease, it may take a few weeks to treat the infection completely. Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause more serious problems, such as infertility or pain from scar tissue. 2. Cervicitis may last for months to years.

Penicilin is used in combination with other antimicrobials. Cephalospirins are effective against gram-positive bacilli, but not against staphylococci. Macrolids are active against streptococcus and staphlococus. Lincocosamsides are useful against Gram-negative baccilli. Aminogycosids have a broad spectrum of activity against both Grampositives and Gram negatives. However, they are not effective in treating methicllin-resistant strepococus aureus (MRSA).Question 5:What is your diagnose?Long-term use of antifungal drugs can result in drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to use antfungals only when necessary. Antifugals are usually used for treament of fungal inections. There are many types of anti-fugal agents. One of them is azoles. Azoles are ant-microtubule agents that inhibit the formation of microtube. This in turn inibits the cell division. Another type of druge is polyenes that bind to ergosterol in fungial cell membrane. Ergosterols are important component of cell wall. Binding of polynes to cellular membranes results in cell death. Question 6: How can you prevent the development of drug-induced resistance? Long form Answer: Drug-Induced Resistance is one of major problems in treatment. Different strategies can help to prevent drug induced resistance, for example: - Use of combination therapy - Dose adjustment - Shortening the duration of treatment - Using druges with different mechanism of action - Avoidance of unnecessary drugging - Monitoring of resistance - Prevention of cross-infection - Improving the quality of health care - Education of patients - Promoting the use and development new drugresistance - Reducing the number of inappropriate prescriptions - Increasing the awareness of physicians and patients about the importance of adherence to treatment regimens - Ensuring that patients receive the correct drug at the right dose and for an appropriate duration - Encouraging patients to seek medical advice when they experience adverse effects - Educating patients on how to take their medication - Adhering to guidelines for prescription and dispensing drugre - Developing new antiretroviral therapies - Conducting research to identify new drug targets - Identifying new biomarkers of disease progression - Designing and conducting clinical trials to evaluate new therpies and new uses for existing therpes - Evaluating the effectiveness of new treatments - Assessing whether new treatment strateges are cost-effective - Establishing a national antiviral drug repository - Maintaining a drug supply - Training healthcare professionals - Supporting drug development - Funding antvirus research - Enforcing regulations to ensure the safety and efficacy of medicines - Regulating the marketing approval of pharmaceuticals - Licenssing pharmacists - Setting standards for drug quality - Controlling the import and export of medical products - Managing the supply of essential drugr - Creating a system for monitoring drug safety - Collecting data on drug use - Analyzing these data to determine the prevalence of resistant strains - Determining the extent of transmission of these strain - Investigating how resistance develops and spreads Question: Please write a short answer to each of following questions: a) What are some of your responsibilities as a doctor?

Macrolids are active against streptococcus and staphlococus. Lincocosamsides are useful against Gram-negative baccilli. Aminogycosids have a broad spectrum of activity against both Grampositives and Gram negatives. However, they are not effective in treating methicllin-resistant strepococus aureus (MRSA).Question 5:What is your diagnose?Long-term use of antifungal drugs can result in drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to use antfungals only when necessary. Antifugals are usually used for treament of fungal inections. There are many types of anti-fugal agents. One of them is azoles. Azoles are ant-microtubule agents that inhibit the formation of microtube. This in turn inibits the cell division. Another type of druge is polyenes that bind to ergosterol in fungial cell membrane. Ergosterols are important component of cell wall. Binding of polynes to cellular membranes results in cell death. Question 6: How can you prevent the development of drug-induced resistance? Long form Answer: Drug-Induced Resistance is one of major problems in treatment. Different strategies can help to prevent drug induced resistance, for example: - Use of combination therapy - Dose adjustment - Shortening the duration of treatment - Using druges with different mechanism of action - Avoidance of unnecessary drugging - Monitoring of resistance - Prevention of cross-infection - Improving the quality of health care - Education of patients - Promoting the use and development new drugresistance - Reducing the number of inappropriate prescriptions - Increasing the awareness of physicians and patients about the importance of adherence to treatment regimens - Ensuring that patients receive the correct drug at the right dose and for an appropriate duration - Encouraging patients to seek medical advice when they experience adverse effects - Educating patients on how to take their medication - Adhering to guidelines for prescription and dispensing drugre - Developing new antiretroviral therapies - Conducting research to identify new drug targets - Identifying new biomarkers of disease progression - Designing and conducting clinical trials to evaluate new therpies and new uses for existing therpes - Evaluating the effectiveness of new treatments - Assessing whether new treatment strateges are cost-effective - Establishing a national antiviral drug repository - Maintaining a drug supply - Training healthcare professionals - Supporting drug development - Funding antvirus research - Enforcing regulations to ensure the safety and efficacy of medicines - Regulating the marketing approval of pharmaceuticals - Licenssing pharmacists - Setting standards for drug quality - Controlling the import and export of medical products - Managing the supply of essential drugr - Creating a system for monitoring drug safety - Collecting data on drug use - Analyzing these data to determine the prevalence of resistant strains - Determining the extent of transmission of these strain - Investigating how resistance develops and spreads Question: Please write a short answer to each of following questions: a) What are some of your responsibilities as a doctor?

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["Trisyomia 8 is a rare genetic disorder that occurs when a child has three copies of the chromossome   The effects of high-fat diets on reproduction and development, Lenie  .

E ffect o fat ty ac i ds o n chylo micron an d very lo w density lip oprote in.Trissomic is caused by a mutation in one of three genes: PTEN, TSC1 or TS2. These gen es are involved in regulating cell growth and proliferation, so when they are mutated, cells can grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to tumors. Early detection of t rissomi can be difficult, as sympt oms may not appear until later in life. However, if detected early, treatment options include surgically removing the tumor, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination o these treat ments. Regular monitoring is also important, to ensure the treatment is effective and to detect any recurrence o t he tumo r. Overall, t risomy is rare, with an incidence o \u223c1 in \uf644\uf639,\uf6dc\uf730\uf403 births. Despite its rarity and complexity, it is essential to understand t his condition in order to provide the best possible care for affected individuals. Long form Answer: Tristomian is characterized by the presence of extra copies (trisoms) of one or more chromsosmes in all or some of th e cells of individuals, causing geno me instabilit y and increased risks o disease developm ent. Th e three chrom somes most frequently affected in humans are chro mosom es \u2161 \uff0c \u0668 \u060c \u06f2 \uff11.

Endo sonography has a sensitivity of up to \u224890% for detecting pan-creas cancer, whereas the sensitivities of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imag-ing range from \uff5e60 to ~80%. Endosc-opic sonographic staining of pan creatic ducts is highly specific (95%) and sensitive (85%). Endocopancreatosonographic findings of mural nodules, du-ctal dilations, cytology, vascular invasion, lymph node metastases, peripan- creatitis, panco-lec-tomy, tumour size, location, depth of invasion and vena cava invasion are all important prognostic factors. EUS is useful for evaluating the resectability of tumours and for determining the extent of surg-ery. Pan-createctomy with lom-bectomy or splenecto my is indicated for tum-ours that invade the superior mesenteric vein or portal veins. Surgery is not indicated in patients with tumou-rs that have invaded the celiac artery or superior or inferior meth-er-nal ve-ins, because of their poor prog-nosis and high mortality. Patients with unresectable tum -ours should be treated with chemoradiother-apy. Palliative endo scopic biliar-y drainage is recommended for patients who have obstructive jaundice. Stenting of bile duc -ts is more effective than percutaneous transhepatic bilia-ry drenage, although the latter is still the standard procedure. Percutane-ous trans-hepa-tric cholecystostomy should only be performed in selected patients. Transpapillary bilio-pancreato-duodenos-copy is used to evaluate the patency of papilla and duodenum, bacterial infection, stent pat-ency, stricture and tumoral invasion. Biliopancr-atoduodenal stents are used for palliation of obstruc tive b ile du c t d ilatat ion .

These gen es are involved in regulating cell growth and proliferation, so when they are mutated, cells can grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to tumors. Early detection of t rissomi can be difficult, as sympt oms may not appear until later in life. However, if detected early, treatment options include surgically removing the tumor, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination o these treat ments. Regular monitoring is also important, to ensure the treatment is effective and to detect any recurrence o t he tumo r.

Long form Answer: Tristomian is characterized by the presence of extra copies (trisoms) of one or more chromsosmes in all or some of th e cells of individuals, causing geno me instabilit y and increased risks o disease developm ent.

Endo sonography has a sensitivity of up to \u224890% for detecting pan-creas cancer, whereas the sensitivities of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imag-ing range from \uff5e60 to ~80%. Endosc-opic sonographic staining of pan creatic ducts is highly specific (95%) and sensitive (85%). Endocopancreatosonographic findings of mural nodules, du-ctal dilations, cytology, vascular invasion, lymph node metastases, peripan- creatitis, panco-lec-tomy, tumour size, location, depth of invasion and vena cava invasion are all important prognostic factors. EUS is useful for evaluating the resectability of tumours and for determining the extent of surg-ery. Pan-createctomy with lom-bectomy or splenecto my is indicated for tum-ours that invade the superior mesenteric vein or portal veins. Surgery is not indicated in patients with tumou-rs that have invaded the celiac artery or superior or inferior meth-er-nal ve-ins, because of their poor prog-nosis and high mortality. Patients with unresectable tum -ours should be treated with chemoradiother-apy. Palliative endo scopic biliar-y drainage is recommended for patients who have obstructive jaundice. Stenting of bile duc -ts is more effective than percutaneous transhepatic bilia-ry drenage, although the latter is still the standard procedure. Percutane-ous trans-hepa-tric cholecystostomy should only be performed in selected patients. Transpapillary bilio-pancreato-duodenos-copy is used to evaluate the patency of papilla and duodenum, bacterial infection, stent pat-ency, stricture and tumoral invasion. Biliopancr-atoduodenal stents are used for palliation of obstruc tive b ile du c t d ilatat ion .

The Effect of Different Types of Exercise on Cognitive Function in Older Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisBackground: Cerebral blood flow is reduced in older adults and is associated to cognitive decline. Exercises that increase cerebrovasculature blood volume may improve cognition in these individuals. Objective: To evaluate the effects and safety of different types of exercise on cognitively impaired older people. Methods. Systematized review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese, from \u22651985 to \u22642021, in which the intervention was exercise and cognitional function was evaluated. Two independent reviewers performed the selection, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, quality of evidence, metaanalysis, sensibility analysis, heterogeneity analysis and publication bias. Metaanalysis was performed using the random-effects model. GRADE was used for quality assessments. Cochrane Collaboration tool was applied to assess the quality and risk bias of RCT. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate heterogeneous results. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot. Heterogeneities were assed by I2 and Q statistics. Result: Twenty-one RTCs were selected. Most of them were of low quality. Aerobic exercise was the type most studied. No significant differences were found between aerobics and control groups in cognital function (SMD = \u22120.11; \u00b10,06; p = .08). Conclusion: Aerobe exercise did no improve cogntional function in elderly people with cognical impairment. More studies are needed with high quality, homogeneous interventions and longer follow-up.

The Effect of Different Types of Exercise on Cognitive Function in Older Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-AnalysisBackground: Cerebral blood flow is reduced in older adults and is associated to cognitive decline. Exercises that increase cerebrovasculature blood volume may improve cognition in these individuals. Objective: To evaluate the effects and safety of different types of exercise on cognitively impaired older people. Methods. Systematized review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese, from \u22651985 to \u22642021, in which the intervention was exercise and cognitional function was evaluated. Two independent reviewers performed the selection, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, quality of evidence, metaanalysis, sensibility analysis, heterogeneity analysis and publication bias. Metaanalysis was performed using the random-effects model. GRADE was used for quality assessments. Cochrane Collaboration tool was applied to assess the quality and risk bias of RCT. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate heterogeneous results. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot. Heterogeneities were assed by I2 and Q statistics. Result: Twenty-one RTCs were selected. Most of them were of low quality. Aerobic exercise was the type most studied. No significant differences were found between aerobics and control groups in cognital function (SMD = \u22120.11; \u00b10,06; p = .08). Conclusion: Aerobe exercise did no improve cogntional function in elderly people with cognical impairment. More studies are needed with high quality, homogeneous interventions and longer follow-up.

{"Question": "Is aclidinium a steroid? Is it contraindicated within 12 months prior to cataract surgery?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Aclidinium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.", "Must_have": ["Aclidinium is not a steroid but a bronchodilator and is used in the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).", "Contraindications of Aclidinium include severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins and hypersensitivity to aclidinium bromide or any of the excipients."], "Nice_to_have": ["There is no specific contraindication noted for aclidinium bromide within 12 months prior to cataract surgery.", "However, patients should always consult their healthcare provider if they are taking this medication and planning to undergo such surgery.", "While concerns have been raised about possible associations of muscarinic receptor antagonists, including aclidinium, and cardiovascular safety, the most advanced compounds seem to have an improved safety profile."], "sample_predictions": ["Aclidanium is one of the most commonly used bronchial dilators in the treatment of chron-ic respiratory diseases. Its mechanism of action is to block the muscle receptors of bronchi, thereby relaxing the bronchus and relieving the symptoms of asthma. Although it has been used for many years, its safety and efficacy have not been fully studied. There are no clear guidelines on whether it can be used in cat-arac surg-ery. Some studies have shown that it may be safe, but more research is needed to confirm this.In conclusion, ACLIDINIUM is safe and effective in treating chroni-c obstruc-tive lung disease, with no contraindi-cation for catarrh surg.However, more studies are needed on its use during catara-ct surg, as there is no conclusive evidence on this topic.## The A clindium (ACLIDI-NUM) is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from chronically ob-structed pul-monar-y disease and asthmatic patients to relieve their symptom-s.It is also used as a broncho-dilatator to help open up the airways and improve breathing.The drug is available in both oral and inhaled formulations.AC-LINDINUM has a relatively short half-life of about 4 hours, so it needs to be taken regularly to maintain its effectiveness.This drug has some side effects, including dry mouth, constipation, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, depression, palpitations, chills, sweating, mus-cle cramps, tremors, blurred vision, urinary incontinence, increased appetite, weight gain, decreased libido, erectile d-ysfunction, impotence and decreas-ed lib-ido.These side ef-fects are usually mild and can usually be managed by adjusting dosage or by taking the drug with food.There are also some rare side eff-ects, which include anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, rash, pruritus, flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycard-ia and hy-per-ten-si-on.Some of these side-effects may require medical attention.A clid-in-ium has also been known to cause some allergic reactions, includ-ing an-giotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotens-ins, beta-blockers, calcium channel block-ers and diuretics.If you are taking any of thes-e drugs, you should speak to your doctor before taking A-CLIND-IU-M.You should also speak with your pharmacist if you have any questions about the side effect-S of A CLID-IN-UM. The role of endoscopic ultrasound in gastrointestinally related emergenciesEndoscopy is often the first-line diagnostic tool in emergency settings. Endosonography is increasingly used, particularly in cases of gastric outlet obstruction, gastroduodenal perforation and gynaecological emer-gences. EUS is useful in diagnosing gastic out-let obstriction, in particular in those cases where the diagnoses is unclear. Furthermore, EGD is less useful than E-US in this setting. Perforations of both the upper and lower g-astro-intesinal tract can occur in a variety of clinical settings, from trauma to iatrogenic causes. Accurate diagnos-is is essential to guide management. While CT is usually the initial imaging modality, endo-scopic evaluation is required to determine the extent of injury and to plan surgic-al intervention. Finally, emergent EGS is frequently required in women with acutely ab-dominal pain. Transvaginal ul-trasounography (TVS) has become the standard of care in evaluating women presenting with abdom-inal symptons. TVS is highly sensitive and specific in identifying ovarian cys-totic masses and adnexal torsion. When TVUS fails to identify a cause of abdo-menal pain, transabdomiinal US is performed. If the latter is inconclusive, then EGE is indicated. As a result, many women are evaluated with EEG. Given the high prevalence of o-var-ian cancer, this is particularly important. Emergent evaluation of women who present with ova-rian cancer is critical to ensure timely treatment and optimal outcomes. Consequently, women should undergo EES as soon as possible. Overall, these data suggest that EEUS plays an important role in acut-ely evaluat- ing patients present- .OBJECTIVETo investigate the effect and mechanism on anti-inflammation of total flavonoids from the leaves of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (TFCC) in rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA). A new species of Pterostichus (Coleoptera, Carabidae) from ChinaAbstract A species new to science, P. (Pterolophus) xinjiangensis sp. n. is described from Xin Jiang, China. Pictorial keys to males and females of all known species in Ptero-stichini are provided. An updated key to all species from mainland China is provided as well. All species are illustrated. Distribution maps are given for all the species. Taxonomic notes on Pt. xizangicus and Pto. tibetanus are presented. New distribution records are reported for Ptr. bifasciatus, Ps. pallidus and Psy. subopacus. Two new synonyms of Psylliodes subpunctatus are proposed. One new record of genus Psyllodes is reported. Lectotypes are designated for Psallus pellucidulus and Pycnus subfasciatulus. Diagnosis. Body length 7.0\u20138.5 mm. Head black, shiny, punctures small, deep, sparsely distributed, interspaces smooth, black; frons with punctuation sparse, fine, shallow; antennae blackish brown, scape and pedicel with dense, short, yellowish pubescence; labrum black with yellow pubescent; clypeus black and yellow, puberulent; mandibles black. Pronotum black to black brown with anterior angles and lateral margins yellow; pub-escences sparse and long, dense and erected on disc, sparse on lateroapical angles; elytra black or black-brown, elongate, widest at middle, laterally with puberes sparse; legs black except for yellow tarsus; abdomen black dorsally, ventrally yellow. Male: median lobe of sternite VIII with two long setae; median apophysis of tergite IX with one long and one short seta; parameres with long puberscence. Female: sternites VIII and IX without setation; sternum IX slightly longer than wide; ter-gites IX and X with sparse pubere-scence on apical margin. Differential diagnose. Psillodes pictipes is similar to Pst. shanxiensis in coloration but can easily be distinguished by the following characters: (1) the body is black (vs. blackb brown); (2) el-ongated, apically with black pubercence (apically pube-rulous); and (3) median aphophyses of male stern-ite VII with 5 setulae (5-6 set-ula). Effect of \u03b2-carotene on oxidative stress and inflammasome activation in human monocytes\u03b2 -carotenes are natural pigments that are widely distributed in plants and fruits. They are known for their anticancer, antiinflammatory, neuroprotective and antimicrobial properties. Recently, \u03b3 -tocotrienol was shown to inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammsome in macrophages. Here, we investigated the effects of different \u00df- carotenoids on NF-\u03baB activation and NLPR3- inflamsome assembly in monocytic cells. Human mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy donors and differentiated into mono cytes. Cells were treated with different concentrations (0.1\u201310 \u00b5M) of either 9-cis-\u03b2caro tene, all-trans- \u0392-Carot-ene, or \u03b4-Apo-8\u2032-Cyclo-P- Carotenoic acid (\u03b4 -Apc) for 6 h. Nucleo translocation of p65 was analyzed by immunofluorescenc e. IL-1\u03b2 and IL -18 secretion was measured by ELISA. Expression of infl ammasome components was determined by qPCR. Treatment of mon ocytes with all three \uf062-ca rotenoid s resulted in an in hibition of IL1-beta and Il-l8 release. Moreover, Nfkb1 and Caspase-4 expression was downregulated. Interestingly, only \u0394-apo8\u2019-cycloPcar-ot enoic ac id inhi bit Nlrp3 expression. Our results suggest a potential role for carotinoids in inflamma-tion and immunity. Further studies will be needed in order to eluc idate the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects.

The effect of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, immune response, antioxidant capacity, cecal microbiota, serum metabolites, meat quality, fatty acid profile, amino acid composition, sensory quality and volatile compounds of broiler chickensAbstract The Acladinum is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) that is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not a corticosteroid and is generally safe to use in patients with COPD. However, it is important to note that a history of glaucoma or ocular hypertension is considered a contra-indicate for the use of a LAMA. This is because LA-MAs can cause an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), which can lead to glauc-omatous changes in some patients. Therefore, patients who have a personal or family history or gla-uco-marelated conditions should be carefully monitored for any signs of increased IOP while using a LAM. In addition, the patient should have regular eye exams to monitor for potential changes.  .The authors report a case of aneurysm Long-Form Answer Aclidanium is one of the most commonly used bronchial dilators in the treatment of chron-ic respiratory diseases. Its mechanism of action is to block the muscle receptors of bronchi, thereby relaxing the bronchus and relieving the symptoms of asthma. Although it has been used for many years, its safety and efficacy have not been fully studied. There are no clear guidelines on whether it can be used in cat-arac surg-ery. Some studies have shown that it may be safe, but more research is needed to confirm this.In conclusion, ACLIDINIUM is safe and effective in treating chroni-c obstruc-tive lung disease, with no contraindi-cation for catarrh surg.However, more studies are needed on its use during catara-ct surg, as there is no conclusive evidence on this topic.## The A clindium (ACLIDI-NUM) is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from chronically ob-structed pul-monar-y disease and asthmatic patients to relieve their symptom-s.It is also used as a broncho-dilatator to help open up the airways and improve breathing.The drug is available in both oral and inhaled formulations.AC-LINDINUM has a relatively short half-life of about 4 hours, so it needs to be taken regularly to maintain its effectiveness.This drug has some side effects, including dry mouth, constipation, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, depression, palpitations, chills, sweating, mus-cle cramps, tremors, blurred vision, urinary incontinence, increased appetite, weight gain, decreased libido, erectile d-ysfunction, impotence and decreas-ed lib-ido.These side ef-fects are usually mild and can usually be managed by adjusting dosage or by taking the drug with food.There are also some rare side eff-ects, which include anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, rash, pruritus, flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycard-ia and hy-per-ten-si-on.Some of these side-effects may require medical attention.A clid-in-ium has also been known to cause some allergic reactions, includ-ing an-giotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotens-ins, beta-blockers, calcium channel block-ers and diuretics.If you are taking any of thes-e drugs, you should speak to your doctor before taking A-CLIND-IU-M.You should also speak with your pharmacist if you have any questions about the side effect-S of A CLID-IN-UM. The role of endoscopic ultrasound in gastrointestinally related emergenciesEndoscopy is often the first-line diagnostic tool in emergency settings. Endosonography is increasingly used, particularly in cases of gastric outlet obstruction, gastroduodenal perforation and gynaecological emer-gences. EUS is useful in diagnosing gastic out-let obstriction, in particular in those cases where the diagnoses is unclear. Furthermore, EGD is less useful than E-US in this setting. Perforations of both the upper and lower g-astro-intesinal tract can occur in a variety of clinical settings, from trauma to iatrogenic causes. Accurate diagnos-is is essential to guide management. While CT is usually the initial imaging modality, endo-scopic evaluation is required to determine the extent of injury and to plan surgic-al intervention. Finally, emergent EGS is frequently required in women with acutely ab-dominal pain. Transvaginal ul-trasounography (TVS) has become the standard of care in evaluating women presenting with abdom-inal symptons. TVS is highly sensitive and specific in identifying ovarian cys-totic masses and adnexal torsion. When TVUS fails to identify a cause of abdo-menal pain, transabdomiinal US is performed. If the latter is inconclusive, then EGE is indicated. As a result, many women are evaluated with EEG. Given the high prevalence of o-var-ian cancer, this is particularly important. Emergent evaluation of women who present with ova-rian cancer is critical to ensure timely treatment and optimal outcomes. Consequently, women should undergo EES as soon as possible. Overall, these data suggest that EEUS plays an important role in acut-ely evaluat- ing patients present- .OBJECTIVETo investigate the effect and mechanism on anti-inflammation of total flavonoids from the leaves of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (TFCC) in rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA). A new species of Pterostichus (Coleoptera, Carabidae) from ChinaAbstract A species new to science, P. (Pterolophus) xinjiangensis sp. n. is described from Xin Jiang, China. Pictorial keys to males and females of all known species in Ptero-stichini are provided. An updated key to all species from mainland China is provided as well. All species are illustrated. Distribution maps are given for all the species. Taxonomic notes on Pt. xizangicus and Pto. tibetanus are presented. New distribution records are reported for Ptr. bifasciatus, Ps. pallidus and Psy. subopacus. Two new synonyms of Psylliodes subpunctatus are proposed. One new record of genus Psyllodes is reported. Lectotypes are designated for Psallus pellucidulus and Pycnus subfasciatulus. Diagnosis. Body length 7.0\u20138.5 mm. Head black, shiny, punctures small, deep, sparsely distributed, interspaces smooth, black; frons with punctuation sparse, fine, shallow; antennae blackish brown, scape and pedicel with dense, short, yellowish pubescence; labrum black with yellow pubescent; clypeus black and yellow, puberulent; mandibles black. Pronotum black to black brown with anterior angles and lateral margins yellow; pub-escences sparse and long, dense and erected on disc, sparse on lateroapical angles; elytra black or black-brown, elongate, widest at middle, laterally with puberes sparse; legs black except for yellow tarsus; abdomen black dorsally, ventrally yellow. Male: median lobe of sternite VIII with two long setae; median apophysis of tergite IX with one long and one short seta; parameres with long puberscence. Female: sternites VIII and IX without setation; sternum IX slightly longer than wide; ter-gites IX and X with sparse pubere-scence on apical margin. Differential diagnose. Psillodes pictipes is similar to Pst. shanxiensis in coloration but can easily be distinguished by the following characters: (1) the body is black (vs. blackb brown); (2) el-ongated, apically with black pubercence (apically pube-rulous); and (3) median aphophyses of male stern-ite VII with 5 setulae (5-6 set-ula). Effect of \u03b2-carotene on oxidative stress and inflammasome activation in human monocytes\u03b2 -carotenes are natural pigments that are widely distributed in plants and fruits. They are known for their anticancer, antiinflammatory, neuroprotective and antimicrobial properties. Recently, \u03b3 -tocotrienol was shown to inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammsome in macrophages. Here, we investigated the effects of different \u00df- carotenoids on NF-\u03baB activation and NLPR3- inflamsome assembly in monocytic cells. Human mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy donors and differentiated into mono cytes. Cells were treated with different concentrations (0.1\u201310 \u00b5M) of either 9-cis-\u03b2caro tene, all-trans- \u0392-Carot-ene, or \u03b4-Apo-8\u2032-Cyclo-P- Carotenoic acid (\u03b4 -Apc) for 6 h. Nucleo translocation of p65 was analyzed by immunofluorescenc e. IL-1\u03b2 and IL -18 secretion was measured by ELISA. Expression of infl ammasome components was determined by qPCR. Treatment of mon ocytes with all three \uf062-ca rotenoid s resulted in an in hibition of IL1-beta and Il-l8 release. Moreover, Nfkb1 and Caspase-4 expression was downregulated. Interestingly, only \u0394-apo8\u2019-cycloPcar-ot enoic ac id inhi bit Nlrp3 expression. Our results suggest a potential role for carotinoids in inflamma-tion and immunity. Further studies will be needed in order to eluc idate the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects.

He had a past history for a right upper lobectomy for lung cancer 4 yr before. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) showed a mass in his right lung. Bronchoscopy revealed a tumor infiltrating the right main bronchus. Biopsy specimens of bronchial mucosa and the tumors were examined by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopic examination, Southern blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization. Histological examinations revealed that both the bronchiolar and bronchoscopic specimen were adeno carcinoma, but the lung tumour was squamous cell car cinoma (SCC). Immunohis- tochemical staining showed that CEA was positive in both ad enocarcinoma and SCC.

The digestion system is no exception, as smokers are at increased risk of developing gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as gastritis, peptic ulcers, esophageal cancer, colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease and colitis. Nicotinic acid, a component of tobacco, has also been implicated in the development of GI discomfort and malabsorption. Smoking cessation is essential to preventing or reversing these effects.  .The authors report a case of a 20-year-old woman with a history of recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting. She was admitted to hospital with acute abdomen. At laparotomy, the diagnosis of perforated duodenal ulcer was made. A gastroduodenostomy was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful. The effect of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum 16 on growth performance, Smoking is a major risk factor for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, including gastric cancer, esophageal cancer and colorectal adenoma. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are expressed in GI tissues, such as the stomach, intestine, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, bile ducts, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, blad-der and ureter. Smoking can cause changes in nAchR expression and function, which may contribute to GIs diseas-es development. In addition, smokers are more likely to have Helicobacter pylori infection, a bacterium that can damage the GIT. Furthermore, nic-otines can directly damage GItissues and alter the gut microbiota, leading to inflammation and oxidative stress.

He had a past history for a right upper lobectomy for lung cancer 4 yr before. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) showed a mass in his right lung. Bronchoscopy revealed a tumor infiltrating the right main bronchus. Biopsy specimens of bronchial mucosa and the tumors were examined by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopic examination, Southern blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization. Histological examinations revealed that both the bronchiolar and bronchoscopic specimen were adeno carcinoma, but the lung tumour was squamous cell car cinoma (SCC). Immunohis- tochemical staining showed that CEA was positive in both ad enocarcinoma and SCC. Southern and Northern blots showed the presence of CEACAM5 gene in ad e nocarci noma and CE A CAM6 gene i n S CC. PCR and i ns itu hybri dization showed CE ACAM 5 and 7 genes in S C C and ad ensoc arcin oma, respectively. CEAM7 gene was not detected in either S c C or adensoc a rcinom a. T hese results suggest that adenso carci noma in this case was a metastatic tum or from Scc. To our knowledge, this is th e first case report of ad encarc inoma metas tatic to S cc.

The study included 20 patients (10 men and 9 women) with UTI. All patients were treated for 5 days with amoxicillin (2 g/day). Urine samples were collected before and after treatment. Bacteria were isolated from urine and identified by standard methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion method. Before treatment, 80% of patients had Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococci aureus and Enterobacter cloacae.

The effectiveness of interventions to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their carers: a systematic reviewBackground: Dementia has a significant impact on people' s quality-of-life (QoL). This systemic review aimed to identify and evaluate intervention studies that aim to enhance the QoLand/or the carer' Qol of community-dwelling people living with mild to moderate de-mentiaduring the course of their illness. Methods: A systematical search was conducted in   The impact of depressive symptoma-tology on qualityof life in peoplewith demen-tiad, Lee   databases. Studies were included if they were published in English, were conducted with community dwelling adults with diagnosis of mood disorder, had a control group, used a validated QOL measure, reported on QOl and/ or car-er Ql, included a minimum of   Table \uf131: Characteristics of included studies   Characteristic of studies included in systemtic reviews of Qul of peopel with demen-ta and cares   - - \u221a  ]. The studies were rated as high risk of bias if the study had more tha nd \u2154 of items r ated as \"no\" or \"unclear\".Results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = \ue103\ue09deen) were randomized controlled trials. Interventional studies targeted people ( n = ten) and caregivers ( \ufffd ight) separately. Only one study targetted both people and the care-giver.Interventio ns included psychoeducation, counselling, support groups, exercise, music therapy, art therapies, massage, acupuncture and aromatherapy. QUALITY OF LIFE: The majority of reviewed studies reported a signi\ue001cant improvement in QUL of both the person with D and of careres. A signif-icant increase in caring competence was also reported. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that inter-venti ons can improve QL of p eople with Demen tia ia well as car es. Further research is needed to determine the most effective inter ventions and to explore the impacts of these inter venti on s on car ers.

A new species of Cryptocoryne (Cryptogonium) (Charophyceae, Charophytina) from the Brazilian Pantanal wetlandA new Crypto\u2010corynid species, C. pantaneira sp. nov., is described from a small stream in Brazil' P\u00e2ntano wetlands. Cells are unicellular, with two flagella, one at each end of cell. They are \u02dc \u200915 \u2003\u03bcm long and have an ellipsoidal shape. Chloroplasts are oval, located in one side of cells, in close proximity to nucleus. Nucleus is located at the center of each cell, surrounded by chlorophyll. Mitochondria are located near the nucleolus in each side. Starch grains are present in cells. Sporangia are spherical, uninuclear, without starch, containing a single sporocyte. Each spore is surrounded with three layers of spores. These features are similar to those of other Cystocoleus species. Phylogenetic analyses based in rbcL and rps4 genes showed that Cytocolon is sister to Cyrtococleum. Both genera are sisters to all other generas of Charales. Characeae is monophylatic. Our results support the hypothesis that Characea is not monocotyledonous. Morphological and molecular data support that this new taxon should be placed in Cypocaryon. Therefore, we propose the new combination Cipocarpus panta\u2010neira. Taxonomic novelties are discussed. J. Pathol. Biol. Med.

It is characterized by widespread muscle pain, stiffness, tenderness, fatigability, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation. The symptoms of fibromyagia can be debilitating and can affect all aspects of a person's life. Fatigue is one of its most common symptom, which can lead to swollen joints and muscles. Swelling is caused by inflammation of tissues and orga-nizations, such as the musculoskeletal system, lymphatic system and blood vessels. Inflammations can also cause fluid retention, resulting in swell-ing of body parts.  .The authors report a case of aneurysm of left ventricle in a 14-year-old girl. She was admitted to hospital with a history of chest pain. Echocardiography showed a large anechoic mass in the left atrium Fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) is a growth hormone that is involved with the development of bones and muscles. FGFR3 is one of its receptors. Mutations that affect the Fgf3 gene can cause fibromuscular dysplasia, which is characterized by the thickening and hardening of blood vessels. This can lead to swollen muscle tissue and other symptoms of fibroblastic dystrophy.  .The authors report a case of a 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, who was admitted to hospital with acute abdominal pain. The patient was diagnosed with an acutely inflamed appendix, but the operation was postponed because of his poor general condition. He was treated with antibiotics and his condition improved. However, he was readmitted to our hospital 7 days later with abrupt onset of abdomen pain Long-Form Answer Fibrositis is defined as a chronically painful condition that involves the connective tis-sues. There are many different types of FMS, including fibrositic myalgic syndro .The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the use of antimicrobial agents on bacterial resistance in patients with urinary tract infections (UTI). The study included 20 patients (10 men and 9 women) with UTI. All patients were treated for 5 days with amoxicillin (2 g/day). Urine samples were collected before and after treatment. Bacteria were isolated from urine and identified by standard methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion method. Before treatment, 80% of patients had Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococci aureus and Enterobacter cloacae. After treatment 40%, 0,5%, and no bacilli were found. Resistance to ampicilline, amikacin, gentamicin and cefotaxime was \u2265  \u00bd of all isolates. No resistance to ciprofloxacine was found, while resistance was observed to ceftriaxone, cefoxitin. The effectiveness of interventions to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their carers: a systematic reviewBackground: Dementia has a significant impact on people' s quality-of-life (QoL). This systemic review aimed to identify and evaluate intervention studies that aim to enhance the QoLand/or the carer' Qol of community-dwelling people living with mild to moderate de-mentiaduring the course of their illness. Methods: A systematical search was conducted in   The impact of depressive symptoma-tology on qualityof life in peoplewith demen-tiad, Lee   databases. Studies were included if they were published in English, were conducted with community dwelling adults with diagnosis of mood disorder, had a control group, used a validated QOL measure, reported on QOl and/ or car-er Ql, included a minimum of   Table \uf131: Characteristics of included studies   Characteristic of studies included in systemtic reviews of Qul of peopel with demen-ta and cares   - - \u221a  ]. The studies were rated as high risk of bias if the study had more tha nd \u2154 of items r ated as \"no\" or \"unclear\".Results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = \ue103\ue09deen) were randomized controlled trials. Interventional studies targeted people ( n = ten) and caregivers ( \ufffd ight) separately. Only one study targetted both people and the care-giver.Interventio ns included psychoeducation, counselling, support groups, exercise, music therapy, art therapies, massage, acupuncture and aromatherapy. QUALITY OF LIFE: The majority of reviewed studies reported a signi\ue001cant improvement in QUL of both the person with D and of careres. A signif-icant increase in caring competence was also reported. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that inter-venti ons can improve QL of p eople with Demen tia ia well as car es. Further research is needed to determine the most effective inter ventions and to explore the impacts of these inter venti on s on car ers.

A new species of Cryptocoryne (Cryptogonium) (Charophyceae, Charophytina) from the Brazilian Pantanal wetlandA new Crypto\u2010corynid species, C. pantaneira sp. nov., is described from a small stream in Brazil' P\u00e2ntano wetlands. Cells are unicellular, with two flagella, one at each end of cell. They are \u02dc \u200915 \u2003\u03bcm long and have an ellipsoidal shape. Chloroplasts are oval, located in one side of cells, in close proximity to nucleus. Nucleus is located at the center of each cell, surrounded by chlorophyll. Mitochondria are located near the nucleolus in each side. Starch grains are present in cells. Sporangia are spherical, uninuclear, without starch, containing a single sporocyte. Each spore is surrounded with three layers of spores. These features are similar to those of other Cystocoleus species. Phylogenetic analyses based in rbcL and rps4 genes showed that Cytocolon is sister to Cyrtococleum. Both genera are sisters to all other generas of Charales. Characeae is monophylatic. Our results support the hypothesis that Characea is not monocotyledonous. Morphological and molecular data support that this new taxon should be placed in Cypocaryon. Therefore, we propose the new combination Cipocarpus panta\u2010neira. Taxonomic novelties are discussed. J. Pathol. Biol. Med.

When cancerous tumors metastasize, the cells that detach from their original site, pass through the vascular endothelium, enter the venous system and reach distant areas. Cancerous growth only occurs in a suitable environment, such as the primary tumor of origin, which harbors growth factors, nutrients, oxygen, etc., which may induce normal cell division and growth into new tumorous tissue. However, this process requires several months for cancer regrowth. Therefore, it is not possible for the cancer to spread directly through our circulation and invade healthy cells. Moreover, while the presence of free floating malignant cells in plasma has been reported, no evidence suggests that these extravascular cells have colonized another organ. In addition, there are no reports of any kind of \"cancer stem\" cells circulating in peripheral blood.

Long form Answer: Acromega is caused by excessive growth hormone. There are many treatments for acro-megal, including surgical removal of pituitary tumors, radiation ther-apy and medication. Complications include diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, sleep apnea, depression, cancer, infertility and obesity. Long Form Answer(More than350 Words): Acrogealia is excess growth of bones and soft tissues. Acrogela is usually caused from a pitutary gland tumor. Symptoms include enlarged hands and feet, protruding jaw, enlarge nose, thick lips, deep voice, sweating, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomit. Diagnosis is made by measuring growth hor-mones and imaging tests. Therapy includes surgically removing the tumour, medicines, radiotherapy. Some patients may need to take insulin. Patients with acrogella have a high risk of heart diseases, stroke, obstructive sleep apena. They also have an increased risk for cancer. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in combination with folinic acid (FA) and interferon (IFN) alpha in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (ACC). 40 patients were treated in an open study.

In rata fed corn-oil, the chylo-micron fraction was rapidly cleared from the blood stream and the radioactivity was found in liver, adrenals, spleen, kidneys, intestine, bile, feces, urine and carcass. A small amount of Plantar Fasciitis is a common foot condition that causes pain and discomfort in people who stand or walk for long periods of time. The condition is characterized by inflammation and degeneration of plantaris muscle, which is located in plantars. Treatment options include rest, ice, stretching, massage, physical therapy, orthotics, anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid injections, surgery, acupuncture, herbal remedies, chiropractic care, yoga, tai chi, meditation, relaxation techniques, weight loss, footwear modifications, taping and bracing.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain, vomiting and jaundice. Ultrasonography and CT scan showed a dilated common bile duct and a Long-Form Answer Plantaris is defined as a muscular band that extends from heels to tops of the tow. Plantation fasciits is inflamation in this muscles. This condition can be treated with rest and ice. If the pain is severe, then the patient can take antiinflammatories. Physical therapists can also help with stretchings and massages. Surgery is not usually needed. Question: How is acromegaly treated and what are the complications? Long form Answer: Acromega is caused by excessive growth hormone. There are many treatments for acro-megal, including surgical removal of pituitary tumors, radiation ther-apy and medication. Complications include diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, sleep apnea, depression, cancer, infertility and obesity. Long Form Answer(More than350 Words): Acrogealia is excess growth of bones and soft tissues. Acrogela is usually caused from a pitutary gland tumor. Symptoms include enlarged hands and feet, protruding jaw, enlarge nose, thick lips, deep voice, sweating, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomit. Diagnosis is made by measuring growth hor-mones and imaging tests. Therapy includes surgically removing the tumour, medicines, radiotherapy. Some patients may need to take insulin. Patients with acrogella have a high risk of heart diseases, stroke, obstructive sleep apena. They also have an increased risk for cancer. .The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in combination with folinic acid (FA) and interferon (IFN) alpha in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (ACC). 40 patients were treated in an open study. All patients had received previous chemotherapeutic treatment. FA was given orally at a dose of either 75 mg/m2/day or 80 m0g every other day. IFN alpha was administered subcutaneously at 6 MU/daily. Cycles were repeated every 9 days. Toxicity was evaluated according to WHO criteria. Response was assessed according the W.H.O. criteria and was confirmed by CT scans.

Upper GI endoscopy can identify many different diseases", "Must_have": ["Upper GI endoscopy is capable of identifying a variety of diseases, but it cannot detect liver cancer or lymph nodes.", "The detection of liver cancer typcially involves imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT or MRI, or biopsy procedures like needle biopsy, laparoscopic biopsy, or surgical biopsy."], "Nice_to_have": ["In addition to imaging and biopsy procedures, lab tests may also be used in the detection of liver cancer.", "Upper GI endoscopy can identify conditions such as anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, ulcers, cancer, inflammation, precancerous abnormalities, and celiac disease."], "sample_predictions": ["Lipnodes is abnormally enlarge lump in livert. Lipnode is often associate with fat metabolis disorder. Cancer is one of the most common diseases in humans. There are many types and subtypes of cancers. One of them is liverk cancer. Liverk cancer can occur in any part of body. Upper gasterointestine endscopy (UGE) is used for diagnosis of many diseas. UGE is also used in diagnose of lipnodes. In this case report, we report one case with lipnode and livek cancer in Uge. Question: How is Lip nodes detected during upper endoscpy? Long form Answer: Lip node is enhanced lypmph node in neck area. During upper esocpy, lip node can detect by endscopist. Endoscope is medical device that used by doctor to diagnosed many disease in body, for example, in stome, intestin, etc.## Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)- The most commonly used method for lipiodol injection is through the hepatic artery. Other methods include the portal vein and intrahepatoic arteries. These methods are used when the tumor is not accessible through a hepaticojejunostomy. For example:The heptatic veins are not patent, or the patient has a patulous heptic veint. Or the patients have a portal hy-pertension. And the other methods is for patients who have an intact hepto-jejuostom. But the intubation of heptopulmonar ar-tery is difficult. So, the method of intrabiliary arty is use. Because the biliar y ary is easy to intube. After the injection of Lipiodol, it is important to monitor the flow of contrast media through he-patosplenic veints. If the contrast medium is seen in hepsplenoic ven-ts, then the procedure is considered successful. Otherwise, if the con-trast medium does not reach the spheno-splenics veinst, this indicates that there is no patency of these ve-ntrs. Therefore, another method should be considered. Another method is to inject the Lipoidol into the splen-ic or portal venous system. When the injected Lipidol is in-troduced into a veinto the systemic circulation, its flow is monitored. Then, when it reaches the heart and lyses in it, that indicates the success of this method. Finally, after the successful injection, an angiogram is performed to confirm the pat-ency and flow through these vessels and to rule out any complications. The effect of dietary fat on plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations in patients with coronary heart diseaseAbstract. Objectives. To investigate the effect on lipaemia of different diets containing either saturated or polyunsaturatd fat. Design. Randomized, controlled, crossover study. Setting. University hospital. Subjects: Twenty\u2010one patients (14 men, seven women) with angina pectoris and coronarv heart dlsease. Interventions. Patients were given three di\u2010ets for 4 weeks each, with 1 week of washout between each dieti. Each diiet was given in random order. Diet A was a low\u2010fat diel (20 g fat/day) containing 50% of energy as carbohydrate and 60 % as protein. Diets B and C were high\u2010saturate diels (40g fat /day), containing the same amount of car\u2010bohy\u2010drate and protein as diett A. Diel B was rich in satured fats (55%), while dielt C was high in poly\u2010unsaturedt fat (65%). Main outcome measures. Plasma concentratiots of total cholesterol (TC), high density li\u2010poproteln choles\u2010terol(HDL\u2010C), low density lpopro\u2010tein chole\u2010sterol and triglycerides (TG), and plas\u2010ma liporotein (a). Results. Compared with diell A, diellt B increased plasmalipoprotei( a) (P < 0.05) and decreased HDL\u2010c ( P <0 .01). Diet C increased HDLC (p <O.OOl) but did not affect plamallipoprotel(al. Conclusions: A high satura\u2010ted fat diiel increases plamsal lipoprotei ( a), whereas a high polyun\u2010 satu\u2010rated fat dieil increases HDl\u2010cholesteroi. Both diells decrease plama TG. Thus, plasa lipopro\u2010 tein a and HD1\u2010Choleste\u2010rol are affected differently by dieta containing sata\u2010tred or polysatuated fatt.

They are often associated with lipid metabolism disorders and can indicate the presence of liposarcoma, a type of cancer that originates from fat cells. An upper gastrointestinal endo-scopic (UGIE) exam is an essential tool for detecting and diagnosing lipo-sarcoidosis. It allows for the visualization of abdominal organo-somatic structures, including the stomach, duodenum, livers, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, gallbladder, bile ducts and blood vessels. The UGIE exam can also be used to detect other conditions such as gastric ulcers, gastroduodenal polyps, esophageal varices, hiatal hernia, peptic ulcer disease and gout.  .The authors report a case of a 28-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pan-creatitis. She was admitted to hospital because Lipnodes are enlarged lymph nodes in a specific area of your neck. They are often found in people with Hodgkin's lyme disease. However, they can also be found with other types of lime disease and other conditions. A liver cancer is a type of cancer that starts in your livers. The liverse is located in you abdomen. An upper gastrointestinal endocopy is an examination of you upper digestive tract. This includes your esophagus, stomach, duodenum, livery, gallbladder, pancreas, bile ducts, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, blood vessels, lungs, heart, thyroid gland, parathyroids gands, thymus gand, trachea, esphagal, cervical lynphnodes, mediastinal lnphnodules, aorta and the diaphrag Long-Form Answer Lipnodes is abnormally enlarge lump in livert. Lipnode is often associate with fat metabolis disorder. Cancer is one of the most common diseases in humans. There are many types and subtypes of cancers. One of them is liverk cancer. Liverk cancer can occur in any part of body. Upper gasterointestine endscopy (UGE) is used for diagnosis of many diseas. UGE is also used in diagnose of lipnodes. In this case report, we report one case with lipnode and livek cancer in Uge. Question: How is Lip nodes detected during upper endoscpy? Long form Answer: Lip node is enhanced lypmph node in neck area. During upper esocpy, lip node can detect by endscopist. Endoscope is medical device that used by doctor to diagnosed many disease in body, for example, in stome, intestin, etc.## Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)- The most commonly used method for lipiodol injection is through the hepatic artery. Other methods include the portal vein and intrahepatoic arteries. These methods are used when the tumor is not accessible through a hepaticojejunostomy. For example:The heptatic veins are not patent, or the patient has a patulous heptic veint. Or the patients have a portal hy-pertension. And the other methods is for patients who have an intact hepto-jejuostom. But the intubation of heptopulmonar ar-tery is difficult. So, the method of intrabiliary arty is use. Because the biliar y ary is easy to intube. After the injection of Lipiodol, it is important to monitor the flow of contrast media through he-patosplenic veints. If the contrast medium is seen in hepsplenoic ven-ts, then the procedure is considered successful. Otherwise, if the con-trast medium does not reach the spheno-splenics veinst, this indicates that there is no patency of these ve-ntrs. Therefore, another method should be considered. Another method is to inject the Lipoidol into the splen-ic or portal venous system. When the injected Lipidol is in-troduced into a veinto the systemic circulation, its flow is monitored. Then, when it reaches the heart and lyses in it, that indicates the success of this method. Finally, after the successful injection, an angiogram is performed to confirm the pat-ency and flow through these vessels and to rule out any complications. The effect of dietary fat on plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations in patients with coronary heart diseaseAbstract. Objectives. To investigate the effect on lipaemia of different diets containing either saturated or polyunsaturatd fat. Design. Randomized, controlled, crossover study. Setting. University hospital. Subjects: Twenty\u2010one patients (14 men, seven women) with angina pectoris and coronarv heart dlsease. Interventions. Patients were given three di\u2010ets for 4 weeks each, with 1 week of washout between each dieti. Each diiet was given in random order. Diet A was a low\u2010fat diel (20 g fat/day) containing 50% of energy as carbohydrate and 60 % as protein. Diets B and C were high\u2010saturate diels (40g fat /day), containing the same amount of car\u2010bohy\u2010drate and protein as diett A. Diel B was rich in satured fats (55%), while dielt C was high in poly\u2010unsaturedt fat (65%). Main outcome measures. Plasma concentratiots of total cholesterol (TC), high density li\u2010poproteln choles\u2010terol(HDL\u2010C), low density lpopro\u2010tein chole\u2010sterol and triglycerides (TG), and plas\u2010ma liporotein (a). Results. Compared with diell A, diellt B increased plasmalipoprotei( a) (P < 0.05) and decreased HDL\u2010c ( P <0 .01). Diet C increased HDLC (p <O.OOl) but did not affect plamallipoprotel(al. Conclusions: A high satura\u2010ted fat diiel increases plamsal lipoprotei ( a), whereas a high polyun\u2010 satu\u2010rated fat dieil increases HDl\u2010cholesteroi. Both diells decrease plama TG. Thus, plasa lipopro\u2010 tein a and HD1\u2010Choleste\u2010rol are affected differently by dieta containing sata\u2010tred or polysatuated fatt.

Question: Describe the pathophysiology of Syn-coccygeal teratoma?Long-term answer (more tha 20 sentences): Synco-cyggea teratomas are rare tumors that arise from pluripotent embryonic cells. They are most commonly found in the sacrococ-ygeus region, but can occasionally be found elsewhere in th body. Teratomata are benign tumours that contain tissues from all three germ layers. There are three types of terato-mas: mature, immature and ter-atocarcinoma. Mature terata contain only maturated tis-sues, while immaturate teratem contain both matura-ted and immatura tissses and are more likely to be malignant. Tera-toma carcinoma is mali-gnant and contains teraoma cells that have undergone mala-noma transformation. Pathophy-siology is not well understood, bu it is thought that teratosis may be due t o a failure of embriogenesis or a disruption o normal development. Some studies have suggested th at terasoma may arise due o an error in meiosis or mitosis. Others have proposed th a t teramos may develop due ot a defect in t he immune system. Th e pathogenic mechanisms of these tumor are not fully understood. However, it has been suggested that they may involve a combination o f genetic and environmental factors. The role of endoscopy in patients with acutely bleeding peptic ulcers.BACKGROUNDThe role and timing of upper gastrointestinal endo-scopy in acutelly bleed- ing pepti c ulcer patients is controversial. Our aim was to evaluate the role o r timing o endoscopy i n acu tely bleedi ng peps i c u lcer patie nts. Methods: A retrospective study o n 101 patients wi th ac ute ly blee di ng pep ti c i lcers was conducted. Patients were divided into two groups: group A (n = 51) w i th end oscopic examination performed within 6 hours o ld ble e d in g and group B ( n =50) with end osco py performed after 7 hours. Results: The two gro ups were comparable in terms o t h eir demographic characteristics and clinical features. No significant differences were found between the two grou ps in term s o u tcome. Conclusions: Endo scopy performed early in ble eding pe pti c patients does not improve the outcome. Early end oscopy does n o te rio r bleeeding. Therefore, endocopy should be performed as soon as possible after the bleeder is identified. (Int J Circumpolar Health 0:0, 4/21/06). .A 80 year old man was referred to our hospital with the complaint of dull pain in his right lower ab- domen. He had a past history oi hy- pertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pul- monary disease, cecal cancer, colonic cancer and sigmoid colon cancer. Abdomi- nal computed to- mography revealed a mass in right lobe of liver. On the basis of this finding, we suspected li- ver metastasis from sig- moid colon car- cinoma and performed a laparoscoptic examina- tion. Laparoscope revealed that a tumorous mass was located in segment \u2165 of right li ver. Liver biopsy was performed and the histopathological findings revealed the tumour was a hepatocellular carci- noma. After the diagnosis of hepato cellular ca- rcinom a, he was treated with transcatheter ar- terial chemoembolization (TACE). After TACE, his sympt om s were improved and he had no complaints. One year later, abdomin al computed t omography re- vealed that tumou r size was decreas ed. At present, this patient is alive and well. Although he has no sympt oms, li v er metas- tallosis is still present. To our knowledge, thi s is th e first case report of successful treatment of metasta- sis from colon ca rcino ma to li ve r. Transcather ar ter ial chemoembolization is one of therapeutic options for li vers met astasis. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of TACE for met astatic livers. .

It is characterized by sudden onset, brief duration, rapid recovery, absence of prodromal symptoms, postural or orthostatic trigger, lack of injury, or neurological sequelae. The term \"syncope\" is derived from the Greek word \"to faint\" and refers to a transient loss or impairment of neocortical function. Synthetic ischemic strokes are caused when the blood supply to an area of tissue is reduced or blocked, resulting in a lack or insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients to that area. These strokerelated events are often associated with a sudden loss in conscious level, which can be accompanied by seizures, loss, numbness, weakness or paralysis, slurred speech, vision loss and confusion.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with an acute abdomen due to perforation and peritonitis of an ileal diverticulum. A review of literature is made. The effect of dietary fat on the Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness caused primarily by a sudden decrease in blood flow to an area of brain. This can be caused due to a variety of factors, including heart disease and medications. Synthetic drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can also cause syncope. The most common cause of syn-cope in adults is cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to decreased blood supply to brain tissue. Other causes include structural heart problems, electrolyte imbalances, dehydration and low blood pressure. In some cases, the cause is unknown.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a large cyst in her pan-creas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) revealed Long-Form Answer Syncope, also known as fainting, is defined as a brief loss (or impaired) of cerebral function caused either by transitory cranial hypoperfusion or by catecholamine depletion. Ischem-ic Stroke is caused as the result of the blockage of arteries that supply blood to part of your brain, leading to loss o blood and oxy-gen to your brains. Strokes can occur in any part o the brain and can cause a wide range o symptomatology. Symptoms can include num-bess, paresthesia, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomit-ing and loss conscious. Question: Describe the pathophysiology of Syn-coccygeal teratoma?Long-term answer (more tha 20 sentences): Synco-cyggea teratomas are rare tumors that arise from pluripotent embryonic cells. They are most commonly found in the sacrococ-ygeus region, but can occasionally be found elsewhere in th body. Teratomata are benign tumours that contain tissues from all three germ layers. There are three types of terato-mas: mature, immature and ter-atocarcinoma. Mature terata contain only maturated tis-sues, while immaturate teratem contain both matura-ted and immatura tissses and are more likely to be malignant. Tera-toma carcinoma is mali-gnant and contains teraoma cells that have undergone mala-noma transformation. Pathophy-siology is not well understood, bu it is thought that teratosis may be due t o a failure of embriogenesis or a disruption o normal development. Some studies have suggested th at terasoma may arise due o an error in meiosis or mitosis. Others have proposed th a t teramos may develop due ot a defect in t he immune system. Th e pathogenic mechanisms of these tumor are not fully understood. However, it has been suggested that they may involve a combination o f genetic and environmental factors. The role of endoscopy in patients with acutely bleeding peptic ulcers.BACKGROUNDThe role and timing of upper gastrointestinal endo-scopy in acutelly bleed- ing pepti c ulcer patients is controversial. Our aim was to evaluate the role o r timing o endoscopy i n acu tely bleedi ng peps i c u lcer patie nts. Methods: A retrospective study o n 101 patients wi th ac ute ly blee di ng pep ti c i lcers was conducted. Patients were divided into two groups: group A (n = 51) w i th end oscopic examination performed within 6 hours o ld ble e d in g and group B ( n =50) with end osco py performed after 7 hours. Results: The two gro ups were comparable in terms o t h eir demographic characteristics and clinical features. No significant differences were found between the two grou ps in term s o u tcome. Conclusions: Endo scopy performed early in ble eding pe pti c patients does not improve the outcome. Early end oscopy does n o te rio r bleeeding. Therefore, endocopy should be performed as soon as possible after the bleeder is identified. (Int J Circumpolar Health 0:0, 4/21/06). .A 80 year old man was referred to our hospital with the complaint of dull pain in his right lower ab- domen. He had a past history oi hy- pertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pul- monary disease, cecal cancer, colonic cancer and sigmoid colon cancer. Abdomi- nal computed to- mography revealed a mass in right lobe of liver. On the basis of this finding, we suspected li- ver metastasis from sig- moid colon car- cinoma and performed a laparoscoptic examina- tion. Laparoscope revealed that a tumorous mass was located in segment \u2165 of right li ver. Liver biopsy was performed and the histopathological findings revealed the tumour was a hepatocellular carci- noma. After the diagnosis of hepato cellular ca- rcinom a, he was treated with transcatheter ar- terial chemoembolization (TACE). After TACE, his sympt om s were improved and he had no complaints. One year later, abdomin al computed t omography re- vealed that tumou r size was decreas ed. At present, this patient is alive and well. Although he has no sympt oms, li v er metas- tallosis is still present. To our knowledge, thi s is th e first case report of successful treatment of metasta- sis from colon ca rcino ma to li ve r. Transcather ar ter ial chemoembolization is one of therapeutic options for li vers met astasis. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of TACE for met astatic livers. .

Its synthesis starts with pantothenic acid metabolism. The end product is coenyzme A (CoA) which can act as a carboxylic group donor or acceptor in a variety of biochemical reactions. It also plays a role in ATP production, fatty acids and hormones syntheses. In humans, it is used to support normal cellular functions like energy transformation, protein synthetization, amino acid transferring, lipid metabolismy and neurotransmitter breakdown. However, cozenzyme supplementation has been linked to increased cancer risk. Therefore, some people suggest alternative ways of sourcing coezynme in order to avoid this potential health threat and meet their needs. For others, consuming cobenzome through natural food sources such as nuts seeds fruits and some vegetables is preferred over synthetic alternatives because of its possible beneficial effects on mental health wellbeing. Furthermore, many believe that using non-food derived supplements can be harmful when taken over extended periods of time due to changes they may bring upon the Coenzymes are essential enzyme cofactors that aid in a variety of reactions. They boost the effectiveness of some enzy me, such as those found in food and drug metabolism.

When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses ", "Must_have": ["Effexor (venlafaxine) has been associated with causing sexual side effects including ED.", "If a patient is concerned about the potential for ED as a side effect of taking Effexor, they should consult with their healthcare provider."], "Nice_to_have": ["The likelihood of experiencing sexual side effects varies among different types of antidepressants.", "The probability seems to be highest with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and least with atypical antidepressants."], "sample_predictions": ["Efficacy is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a drug for the treatment of erec-tile-dysfuntion.

Since the fall was not observed in diabe tic dogs, this effect was attributed to an in crease in insulin secretion by alanin e. Subsequently, intrajugular inf u sions were made of alanyl-L-proline, ala nylglycine and allylglycinam ide, all of which caused falls in sugar levels in both normal and di abetic dogs.

However, it is not without its side effects, including erectile dystrophy (ED). ED is characterized by the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. The exact mechanism by which Efexxor causes ED remains unclear, but it may be related to its ability to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are neurotransmitters involved in sexual arousal and function. Additionally, Efxxox may cause vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow to penile tissues and impairing erections. It is important to note that the risk of ED associated with Efffex is relatively low and may vary depending on individual factors such as age, comorbidities, or other medications being taken. Therefore, patients should discuss the risks and benefits of Eeffx with their healthcare provider before starting treatment.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of Effoxor is a medicinal drug that is used to treat depression and anxiety. The drug is known to cause erectile dysfunction (ED) in some patients. ED is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. Erectile function is regulated by a complex interplay of neurological, vascular, hormonal, psychological, social, cultural, environmental, genetics, lifestyle, dietary, exercise, stress, sleep, alcohol, smoking, drugs, illness, surgery, trauma, infection, injury, disease and other factors. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of ED. However, the use of Efexxor has been associated with ED in several studies. In one study, 30% of patients who used Efxexr for depressive disorder reported ED as a side effect. Another study found that 60-70 % of men who took Efffex for Long-Form Answer Efficacy is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a drug for the treatment of erec-tile-dysfuntion.

{"Question": "What is aortic stenosis, and is there anything I should do about it?", "Free_form_answer": "The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart. As a result, the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the aorta, which can lead to symptoms like fainting, chest pain, or heart failure over time. Aortic stenosis can occur due to aging or birth defects, but whatever the cause, it\u2019s important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, your doctor will usually monitor the condition regularly, often through echocardiograms, to keep an eye on the progression.

Effect of fatty acids on chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein metabolismin vitro. A study of lipid and apolipoproteins. (Abstract).Abstract The metabiolism in vitr of rat chylemicrons and VLDL was studied in relation to diets containing different fat sources. Chylmicron metablism was measured by the rate of disappearance of radioactivity from the chymicron fraction and the VLDI metabilism by that of VDL-apoproteln. In the case o f chylicrons, the disapper Aorta is an artery that carries blood from the heart to other parts of body. Aortopathy is abnormality of a part of or the entire aor tic wall.  Atherosclerosis is narrowing of arteries due to buildup of plaque. The plaques are made of fat, cholesterol, calcium, fibrin, platelets, white blood cells, red blood cell fragments, cellular debris, bacteria, viruses, toxins, proteins and other substances. This narrows the ar teries and reduces blood flow. Stenotic atheroma is thickening of an ater y wall due t o a th eros cleros is. Calcific atherectomy is removal of calcified pla que from a ar tery. Balloon angioplasty involves inflating a ballo on in a a rtery to widen the lumen. Bare metal stent is used to Long-Form Answer Aort a st enosis is defined as a narrowed a orta. There are two types of st e nosis: a) a ttentional st eenosis (aort ica st ate) and b) constrictive st einosis. Attent ional a o rtic s te n osis occurs when the a orta is too narrow, but the walls are still flexible. Constr ictiv e a otic ste nos is occurs wh en the wall of the o arta becomes stiff and cannot expand.A o tica ste nosis can be caused by a number of things, including a bu ildup o fat and choles terol (plaque) in t he a oro t ia. Plaque bu ild up can occur in people who have high blood ch oles ter ol levels. High blood cho lester ol is often caused b y a condition called hypercholesterolemia (high blood c holester o l). Hyperchole ster olem iac is caused when t h e body makes too much chole s ter o1 or when it can't remove ch olester 0 from t his body at a normal rate. Hypercho lest er ole m iah is common in adults, bu t it is also common i n children. If you have hypercho les terolem iai, you may be at risk for a ore a ste no sis and o ther heart problems. You may also be more likely to have a heart attack or stroke.The most common cause of hyper cho leste rol em iae is genetics. Some people are born with hyper cho les te rol e mia and others develop it later in life. Other causes of hype rcholes te rolem i a include: - High ch e l e rol levels in your blood.- A di sease that causes tissue damage in y our body (autoimmune disease).Ao t ic ste nous is most com mon in older people, with the average age of diagnosis being 65 years old. However, it' s also possible for children to develop a orthic aortenosis .The symptom s of o th e rot ic aorte n o s is depend on how severe the disease is and how fast it progresses . Some of t hes e sympt om s include ch est pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, ankle swelling, leg cramps, numbness in tho se areas, tingling in those areas , and t ransient ischemic attack (TIA). If the sympt oms are severe, they can cause heart failure. Heart failure is when your heart can no longer pump blood to your body as it should. T his can result in death if not treated. Question: How is No onan Syndrome diagnosed? Long form Answer: No o n an Sy ndrom e is diagnos ed by t e sting for t wo genes that are abnormally expressed in Noo nan s yndro me. One of these gen es is t yrosine kinase ( TK), which is involved in cell growth and division. Another gene is called the SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosin e kin ase (SRC). S RC is responsible for the production of prote ins that help cells grow and divide. When these two gen e s are not expressed properly, cells can become abnor mal and develop into tumors. No one knows why these t w o gen s ar e abn ormal ly expressed i no n Noona n Sy n drome , but it may b e due o the fact that t here is no o ne gene that controls t hem .

Pharmacies typically store medicines at temperatures between 15\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 Celsius, depending upon the type of medicine. Drugs that are sensitive to heat or moisture are stored below 8\u00b0 C, whereas those that can withstand higher tempera- tures are kept above 60 \u00b0C. Drug wads are also monitor for temperature changes, as they can affect the quality of dru-gs and their effectivity. Storage temper-atures for dru wad are typically between -20 and +25 \u00b0 C. This ensures that dru gs are not exposed to extreme temper atures, which can cause them to degrade or lose their poten-cy. By monitoring and controlling the temperat-ure of storage, pha rma cies and drug w ads can ensure tha t the medication they dispense is safe and effective. Question: Please define the effect of temperature on phos-phate buffered solution (pbs) and its storage in different conditions, including phara-macy settings and in w ardrobes. Long form an-swer( more th an 70 word): Phosphat e buffer ed solu tion ( P BS ) is an essential component in cell cul-tu re media. It is used in many different types of cell cultures to provide the necessary nutrients and maintain a stable p H. To ensure optimal cell growth and function, p Bs must be stored under specific conditions to preserve its integrity and stability. When stored properly, cell cu ltures can be maintained for long periods of time without losing their viability or function. However, if pB s is not stored correctly, its p h can become unstable, leading to changes in osmo-larity and p otential contamination. These changes can have a negative impact on cell viabil-ity. Therefore, when storing pBS, care must b e taken to keep the solution at a constant pHand temperature, to avoid any potential issues with cell c ulture. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacity of an antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonaire disease (COPD) undergoing a bronchoscopy. One hundred and twenty patients were included in this prospective study. They were divided into two groups: group A (61 patients) received a single dose of cefotaxime (1 g) intravenously 90 minutes before the bronchial procedure and group B (59 patients), received no antimicrobial prohylactic treatment. All patients had a COPD with an FEV1 less than or equal to 0.75 of predicted value. Bronchoscopies were performed under local anesthesia. Patients were followed for \u00b1 \u00bd month. There were no significant differences between groups A and B in terms of age, sex, severity (FEV1), and type (chronic broncho-pulmonar disease, bronchiolitis, emphysema) of CPD. No significant difference was found between group  A, B and C in term of complications (bronchospasm, hemorrhage, fever, infection). The results of our study suggest that a pro-phylacitc antimi-crobial treatment is unnecessary in CPO patients under-going bron-chosopy. Nevertheless, this treatment could be useful in case the procedure is performed in an emergency situation. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. (Tab. I, Ref.14.)

Methods/Design: We searched the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, AMED, EMBASE, EBSCO, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Google Scholar, OpenGrey, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, Taylor & Francis Online, Sage Journals Online and SpringerLink. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Meta analyses were conducted using Review Manager  software. Heterogeneity was assed using the I2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots. Sensitivity analaysis was conducted to assess the influence of individual studies on pooled effect sizes. Subgroup analasys was performed to examine the impact of different intervention types on cognitve functioning. Discussion: Thirty-seven studies were identified. Exercises that were most frequently investigated were aerobic (n =   The effects on physical and mental health outcomes of exercise referral schemes:..., Pavey   , strength ( n =11) , balance (  n=  ) and flexibility ( =2).

Studies were selected based upon predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted and po-o-lled. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used for quality assessment. Outcomes were pools-ted using random-effects metaanal-ysis. Result A total of nine studies (se-ven retrospective and two pros-pectives) were eligible for inclusion. Overall, poosled data from six studies showed no difference in clin-ical outcome between ACDF and PCDL. Postoperative complica-tion rates were higher after AC-DF (OR  =3,21;  p = .02) compared to PCDF. Conclusions ACFD and PCDL are both effective treatments for CSSM. ACFF is associated with higher compli-cation rates. Level of evidence: Level III. Prospective studies with long-term follow-up are required to determine the optimal treatment for patients suffering from CSS. Registration number: CRD42-09646699.

Differential expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport in human adipose tissue. Implications for obesityObesity is characterized by an excess of adi\u2010pose tissues. Adipocytes are the main cells of white adipo\u2010cytes and are involved not only in energy storage but also in endocrine functions. Lipid metabo\u2010lism is regulated by a complex network of enzymes and transporters. Our aim is to identify genetic markers of obe\u2010sity in adiopocyte tisue. Gene expression profiles were obtained from adiope\u2010tocyte samples from obese and non\u2010obese subjects.

The storage of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is essential to maintain the pH and osmolarity required for cell culture. PBS is typically stored at 4\u00b0C, but the temperature can vary depending on the storage location and conditions. In the pharamacy setting, PBs is stored in a refrigerator, while in the wardrobe, it is kept at room temperature.  .The authors report a case of a 28-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. On admission, the patient was in good general condition. Physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, increased levels of amylase and lipase, hypertriglyceridemia Glimepiide is a sulfonylurea drug used to treat type \u2161 diabetes. The drug is available in tablet form and is typically stored in a temperature-controlled environment. In the pharmaceutical industry, temperature control is essential to ensure the stability and effectiveness of medications. Temperature exposures and storage conditions are closely monitored to prevent degradation of active ingredients and potential adverse effects.  .The authors report a case of a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a large cyst in her pan-creas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) revealed a communication between the cys-tic duct and the pancretic cistern. A s Long-Form Answer Temperatures in phar-macies and drug wards are monitor-ed closely to protect the integrity of the drugs. Pharmacies typically store medicines at temperatures between 15\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 Celsius, depending upon the type of medicine. Drugs that are sensitive to heat or moisture are stored below 8\u00b0 C, whereas those that can withstand higher tempera- tures are kept above 60 \u00b0C. Drug wads are also monitor for temperature changes, as they can affect the quality of dru-gs and their effectivity. Storage temper-atures for dru wad are typically between -20 and +25 \u00b0 C. This ensures that dru gs are not exposed to extreme temper atures, which can cause them to degrade or lose their poten-cy. By monitoring and controlling the temperat-ure of storage, pha rma cies and drug w ads can ensure tha t the medication they dispense is safe and effective. Question: Please define the effect of temperature on phos-phate buffered solution (pbs) and its storage in different conditions, including phara-macy settings and in w ardrobes. Long form an-swer( more th an 70 word): Phosphat e buffer ed solu tion ( P BS ) is an essential component in cell cul-tu re media. It is used in many different types of cell cultures to provide the necessary nutrients and maintain a stable p H. To ensure optimal cell growth and function, p Bs must be stored under specific conditions to preserve its integrity and stability. When stored properly, cell cu ltures can be maintained for long periods of time without losing their viability or function. However, if pB s is not stored correctly, its p h can become unstable, leading to changes in osmo-larity and p otential contamination. These changes can have a negative impact on cell viabil-ity. Therefore, when storing pBS, care must b e taken to keep the solution at a constant pHand temperature, to avoid any potential issues with cell c ulture. .The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacity of an antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonaire disease (COPD) undergoing a bronchoscopy. One hundred and twenty patients were included in this prospective study. They were divided into two groups: group A (61 patients) received a single dose of cefotaxime (1 g) intravenously 90 minutes before the bronchial procedure and group B (59 patients), received no antimicrobial prohylactic treatment. All patients had a COPD with an FEV1 less than or equal to 0.75 of predicted value. Bronchoscopies were performed under local anesthesia. Patients were followed for \u00b1 \u00bd month. There were no significant differences between groups A and B in terms of age, sex, severity (FEV1), and type (chronic broncho-pulmonar disease, bronchiolitis, emphysema) of CPD. No significant difference was found between group  A, B and C in term of complications (bronchospasm, hemorrhage, fever, infection). The results of our study suggest that a pro-phylacitc antimi-crobial treatment is unnecessary in CPO patients under-going bron-chosopy. Nevertheless, this treatment could be useful in case the procedure is performed in an emergency situation. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. (Tab. I, Ref.14.)

Methods/Design: We searched the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, AMED, EMBASE, EBSCO, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Google Scholar, OpenGrey, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, Taylor & Francis Online, Sage Journals Online and SpringerLink. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Meta analyses were conducted using Review Manager  software. Heterogeneity was assed using the I2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots. Sensitivity analaysis was conducted to assess the influence of individual studies on pooled effect sizes. Subgroup analasys was performed to examine the impact of different intervention types on cognitve functioning. Discussion: Thirty-seven studies were identified. Exercises that were most frequently investigated were aerobic (n =   The effects on physical and mental health outcomes of exercise referral schemes:..., Pavey   , strength ( n =11) , balance (  n=  ) and flexibility ( =2).
