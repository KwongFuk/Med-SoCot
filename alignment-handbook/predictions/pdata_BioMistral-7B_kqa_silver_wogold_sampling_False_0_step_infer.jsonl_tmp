Long-Form Answer Sore throat is a common symptom that can have a variety of causes. It is usually caused when the mucous membranes of one or both tonsils become inflamed. This inflammation can result from a bacterium or virus infection, or from an irritant such a chemical irritation or physical trauma. The pain of a one-side sore-throats is caused from inflammatory cells infiltrating the tonsil. Inflammasome activation is an important step in inflamma-tory responses. Tonsilitis is inflama-mat-ory disease of tonsilla. Activation of infla-mmasome is important in this disease process. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 6 (PYCARD) is required for the activation of caspase-1 and the production of interleukin- (IL-) \u03b2 and IL-23.

It is caused by an allergens such as pollen, dust mites, animal dander, mold spores, cockroaches, pollutants, smoke, chemicals, perfumes, food, medicines, latex, insect bites and stings, chlorine, formaldehyde, cosmetics, hair dyes, tobacco smoke. Long-Form Answer Allergies are hypo-sensitivities to foreign substances. They are classified as either I or II. Type I allerges are caused when an allergen enters the body and binds to IGG E antibodies, which are present in the bloodstream. This causes the release of histamine and other chemicals from the mast cells, resulting in symptoms such a runy nose or water eyes.
