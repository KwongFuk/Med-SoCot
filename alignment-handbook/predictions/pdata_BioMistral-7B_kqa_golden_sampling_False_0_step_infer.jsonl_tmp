{"Question": "And how does Genital herpes and HPV differ?", "Free_form_answer": "HPV infections and genital herpes are sexually transmitted infections that are caused by different viruses and have distinct clinical presentations.\n\nGenital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Both strains of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2, can cause genital and oral herpes lesions. Genital herpes can manifest with fluid-filled blisters on or around the genitals that burst and develop into sores that typically resolve within 1-2 weeks. During the first infection, Swollen lymph nodes and flu-like symptoms may also be experienced.. Outbreaks of genital lesions can reoccur, as the virus never leaves the body after initial infection.\nMost infected individuals are asymptomatic or only experience mild symptoms. HSV is spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and contact with the skin, saliva, or sores of a person who has the infection. Oral antiviral therapy can be used to treat patients with recurrent genital lesions to reduce the severity of symptoms and lower the risk of transmission to an uninfected sexual partner.\n\nA HPV infection is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different strains of HPV. Low-risk strains can cause warts on the skin or genitals, whereas high-risk strains of HPV are associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, such as cervical, throat, mouth, anus and genital cancer. HPV is spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection.

{"Question": "Are lutein and omega 3 good for vision ?", "Free_form_answer": "Lutein is a carotenoid compound which is available in green leafy vegetables (kale, broccoli, spinach, lettuce, and peas), along with other foods, such as eggs, pistachios, and corn. Lutein is found in high concentration in the retina, which is the light sensitive area of the eye. Studies have attributed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and blue light-filtering effects to lutein. The studies suggest that lutein may protect against and reduce the severity of many eye diseases. By reducing damage to the retina, lutein may enhance vision in both normal and diseased eyes.\nDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found naturally in fish, is also found in the retina. DHA is involved in the process of transforming light to a neurological signal and generating light sensitive pigment. Studies on the effects of DHA (omega 3) found mixed results on improvement of vision, but no studies showed a negative effect.

However, if the post-nasals dripping is due anatomical aberrations, then surgical intervention is required. The most common cause of postnatal drippings is deviation of the septal. Deviation in the nasals sept is common and usually does not cause any problems.
