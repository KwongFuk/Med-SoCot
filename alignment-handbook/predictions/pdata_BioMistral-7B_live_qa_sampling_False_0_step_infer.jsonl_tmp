{"Question": "I want information on Beckwith-Wieddeman Syndrome.", "Free_form_answer": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time. The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma.

Surgery is an effective treatment for sleep Long-Form Answer Obstructed sleep Apnea (OSA) is characterized as a repetition of brief episodes during the sleep, where the airways are partially or completely blocked. This leads to a reduction in the oxygen level in your bloodstream. The most common cause of O.S.A is obesity. However, other factors such a deviated septum, enlarged tonsils, or a narrow air passage can also cause Osa. Symptoms of obtrusive sleep include loud snoring, waking up with a gasping or choking sensation, morning headaches, fatigue, memory loss, depression, irritability, high blood pressure, weight loss or gain, insomnia, sleepiness during daytime, nightmares, difficulty concentrating, impotence, decreased libido, etc. If left untreated it may lead towards heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation, pul monary hy pertension and even death . The treatment of sleep depends on several factors, including the severity of symptoms, the presence of underlying medical conditions, lifestyle factors and the patient' s overall health. Treatment options include lifestyle changes such losing weight, changing sleep position, using a CPap machine, oral appliances, surgery, behavioral therapy, acupuncture and hypnosis. Of all these options, CPAp is considered the most effective and widely used treatment.

Such consanguinity is one of the numerous factors that could potentially contribute to the condition, and the individual risk is influenced by many factors including the specifics of the family's genetic makeup.Long-term pulmonary sequelae are possible, as untreated CDH can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia or underdevelopment of the lungs, which may cause respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, and potentially longer-term lung function abnormalities.

Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life.

Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13.

When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.

{"Question": "How does trisomy 7 affect the body and are there any treatments for it?", "Free_form_answer": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.", "Must_have": ["Trisomy 7 is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis and surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features.", "There is no specific treatment for Trisomy 7, as it is a chromosomal abnormality."], "Nice_to_have": ["7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the duplicated chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.", "Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases.", "These alterations often happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align.", "Homologous recombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications."], "sample_predictions": ["Trisomic 4p syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused when a baby inherits three copies of chromsomes  from one of its parents.
