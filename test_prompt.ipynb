       "\"Yes, in rare cases demenita can inherited from parents. But it’s not the only cause. There are many other causes of this disease. For example, Alzhiemer' dememtias is caused when proteins called beta-amyloid and tau form plaques and tangles in the brains of people with the disease\\n. These plaque and\\ntangles can cause damage and death to neurons, leading to the symptoms associated with Alzemier' demensia. Other causes include stroke, head injury, Parkinson' s disease etc\\nAlzheimers disease is the most commonly inherited form deemenita. This is because it has a strong genetic link. If one parent has Alzieimer’ disease then there’ is an increased risk that their child will also develop the same condition\\nThere are several types of inherited deementsia that have been identified. One of these is Alzsiemers deemeintias. Alzmier’ deemsia has been linked to a gene called APOE. People who have two copies of ApoE4 are at a much higher\\nrisk of developing Alzesiemrs deemente than those who do not have this gene. Another type is Huntington' diseas. Huntings disease has also been associated wit\\nh a specific gene, called HTT. Individuals who inherit a mutation in this\\ngene are more likely to develope Huntsing disease than others. Finally, there are also some types deentsia which can occur as the result\\nof a combination of genetic and non genetic factors\\nInheritance of Dimentia:\\nIt is true that deentia cannot be passed on from one generation to another. Deementis is usually caused\\nby a number of different factors including genetical, environmnetal, social, psychological, physical,\\nand other. Genetic factors are the ones that play a major role in causing deenmentias and these are\\nthe ones which cannot pass on to future generations. Environmental factors include things like\\npollution, radiation, chemicals, toxins, stress, diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol, drugs, trauma, injury\\netc. Social factors involve things such a\\ns family, friends, community, culture, religion, work, school, hobbies, interests, activities, relationships, support systems, financial status, housing, transportation, healthcare, access to resources, discrimination, stigma, prejudice, stereotypes, attitudes, beliefs, values, norms, expectations, roles, responsibilities, rights, privileges, duties, obligations, laws, policies, regulations, rules, guidelines, standards, procedures, protocols etc.. Psychological factors refer to things\\nlike thoughts, feelings, emotions, perceptions, cognitions, memories, personality traits, behaviors, habits, patterns, routines, rituals, coping mechanisms, defense mechanisms etc... Physical factors relate to physical health conditions sucha\\nss diseases\\n, disorders, illnesses, injuries, disabilities, impairments, limitations, symptoms, signs, syndromes etc.... Other factors may include spirituality, spiritual beliefs and practices, religious beliefs\\n and rit\\nuals etc.....\\nDeementas can not be inhereted. They are usually the results of environmental, genetic, physiological, psychosocial, cultural, economic, political, legal, ethical, moral, philosophical and religious factors and influences\\nthat affect an individual'\\n' life and well-being.\""
